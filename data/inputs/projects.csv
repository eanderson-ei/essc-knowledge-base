Communities can be the best guarantors of these resources if they receive tangible benefits for their efforts through results-based conservation payments like REDD+ and water funds. The USAID Páramos and Forests Activity responds to these challenges and opportunities to make economic growth and sound environmental stewardship compatible goals in a post-conflict scenario. The goals of the activity are to: (1) Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve water resources in strategic watersheds; (2) Open opportunities for “green” production and payment for environmental services, and (3) Support policies to induce private investment and reward communities for sound conservation practices.

The program supported the establishment of four higher education partnerships between four universities in the United States and seven universities in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru focused on enhancing biodiversity conservation instruction, applied research, and collaboration across the Andean Amazon region. The partnerships were implemented in contexts with high biodiversity importance that are under threat so as to achieve noticeable impact in strengthening the human and institutional capacity of the Andean Amazon region to in turn better address the rapidly changing environmental challenges facing the Amazon. These regions were Rio Branco (Brazil), Florencia and Leticia (Colombia), Yasuni (Ecuador), and Puerto Maldonado and Pucallpa (Peru).",Natural Resources and Biodiversity,,"conservation, deforestation, conservation crime, livelihoods, indigenous peoples, illegal logging, illegal fishing, fisheries, Amazon Vision, vulnerable population, climate change, REDD+, self-reliance, conservation enterprises, farming, NRM, natural resource management, governance",,"Final Report (2015): https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00KP5B.pdf,
