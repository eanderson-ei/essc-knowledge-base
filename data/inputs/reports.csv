Such management has allowed pirarucu fish populations to recover rapidly within protected areas, leading to intense pressure from outsiders who invade the reserves and illegally exploit fish stocks. A key finding of the assessment is the significant and previously unrecognized cost of lake vigilance, which is borne completely by communities, using their own equipment.
