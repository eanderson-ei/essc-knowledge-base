Abstract Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important economic activity in many rural areas, with a long tradition in Colombia. High rates of informality undermine governance, security, and legal economies, and cause significant environmental and social impacts. As the government of Colombia consolidates post-conflict conditions, the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through the “Oro Legal” Activity of the United States Agency for International Development and “Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining,” a public-private partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. A consultative process with a broad array of stakeholder groups yielded consensus on the principal obstacles to ASGM formalization, which create serious disincentives to entry into this process. To enable ASGM operators to transition to formality, a recommendation emerged for a National Unified Formalization Plan, which rests on six proposals that largely align with current policy and legislation. Key Words: Artisanal and small gold mining, formalization, governance, environmental impact, security 1 Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in Colombia: A Proposal for Improving Environmental, Social, and Economic Performance in a Post-Conflict Scenario1 1. Context and problem statement Recent administrations of Colombia have highlighted the importance of legality, pointing to the mining sector as a particular area of interest for national development. In Colombia, gold mining is one of the principle extractive industries. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important economic activity in many rural areas and has a long tradition in Colombian history and culture. ASGM is an increasingly prevalent informal economic activity, typical of countries with weak institutional capacity to adequately control and regulate the sector (Hilson, 2009). In Colombia, this is compounded by a long period of internal conflict where the State was absent from many areas, especially in more rural, isolated ones where ASGM is typically concentrated. In the Colombian context, small-scale mining operations2 correspond to 94 percent of total gold mining operations nationwide, of which 60 percent are untitled operations that are considered illegal and, in many cases, finance organized crime (UNODC, 2018). Substantial incomes from gold mining and the ease of operating informally have attracted more than 500,000 Colombians to this activity since this type of mining is relatively accessible and often the only livelihood option available for vulnerable populations (Hentschel et al., 2002). According to the last Mining Census, conducted in 2011/2012,3 of the 14,357 mining production units (MPUs) recorded, 4,133 MPUs produce gold and account for 90 percent of MPUs that produce precious minerals in Colombia (MME, 2012). Despite the magnitude of this activity, only 13.3 percent of MPUs are legally titled, with 87 percent or 3,584 gold MPUs classified as informal or illegal. With the spike in gold prices between 2010 and 2013 and the subsequent rise in prices over the last 18 months, the number of informal and illegal gold MPUs has undoubtedly increased significantly since the last Mining Census, exacerbating issues surrounding ASGM. Gold mining is a fast-growing source of revenue for the government of Colombia (GOC) and a pillar of many local economies. Nowhere is this truer than in northern Antioquia and along the San Juan and Atrato rivers in Chocó on Colombia’s Pacific coast, which account for 70 percent of ASGM in Colombia (SIMCO, 2017). Both departments have been gold-mining regions since pre-colonial times. Revenues from illegal gold mining in Colombia are difficult to measure because of the “leakage” of illegal gold sold into illicit markets and how illegal gold production is “laundered” into 1 The authors’ views expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the government of Colombia, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) or United States government, or Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development (SECO) or the government of Switzerland. This paper draws on a study on formalization of artisanal and small gold mining commissioned by the USAID Oro Legal Activity and SECO Better Gold Initiative, the recommendations from which were presented to the government of Colombia. 2 Under Decree 1666 of 2016, the Ministry of Mines and Energy defines small-scale gold mining as operations occupying up to 150 ha in the exploration or pre-production phase or extract up to 15,000 tons of ore annually for underground mines and no more than 250,000 m3/year of ore for alluvial mining. 3 The Mining Census includes extractive activities for both precious and non-precious minerals and construction materials. 2 legal gold markets in Colombia. By one estimate, gold mining generated approximately US$2.4 billion in revenues, or three times the amount generated from trafficking cocaine produced in Colombia, with exports registered at US$1.78 billion (ANM, 2018). Like cocaine, illegal mining poses a litany of security, governance, social, and environmental challenges (DuPée, M. C., 2018). Security challenges. As well as providing a livelihood for many marginal rural families, informal or illegal gold mining also finances illegal groups. The list of violent competitors vying for these gold riches is a window into Colombia’s various social fault lines and conflicts: National Liberation Army, or ELN, a leftist guerilla group that comprises approximately 2,000 combatants; El Clan del Golfo, a criminal syndicate; a 1990s-era paramilitary group known as United Self Defense Forces of Colombia or AUC; and former members of the defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC. As a response, the Colombian government has ramped up enforcement with several task forces and campaigns that have disrupted numerous operations. In 2017, Task Force Titan eliminated a massive illegal mining operation in Chocó organized by the Clan del Golfo, destroying more than $4.2 million of heavy machinery and other contraband (DuPée, M. C., 2018). Despite these high-profile victories against illegal actors, interdiction efforts impact a small fraction of overall production in the sector, demonstrating how any approach to improve current policy will involve at least as much “carrot” as “stick.” At this specific juncture, with the backdrop of consolidating the historic peace agreement with the FARC while, at the same time, addressing other security threats and organized crime groups, the challenge facing the GOC and other stakeholders in the gold mining sector is how to exploit the undoubted potential that gold mining offers in a legal, responsible way, while working to strengthen governance and the rule of law. Governance. Governance capacity in the gold mining sector is highly centralized. Of Colombia’s 32 regional governments, only Antioquia enjoys delegated authority for the sector with role of municipalities restricted to local enforcement. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) has a solid legislative platform to underpin change, but specific opportunities for better regulation remain. For example, incentives under Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013 and regulation of Article 248 of Law 685/2001 to expand pathways for legalization/formalization have not materialized. National entities are generally well-resourced, but regional and local capacity varies – for example, Antioquia department has a functioning mining secretariat, but regional entities in Chocó department do not. There is strong demand from departments and municipalities for decentralization of authorities and decision-making (Echavarria, C., 2014). Governance must be understood in its broadest context, extending from the government to ASGM operations and mining associations. Although the MME and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS) have a large set of legislative and regulatory tools, these have not translated into better control, management, or on-the-ground performance by MPUs. For instance, credit facilities have yet to be created for legal miners to eliminate mercury use, per the above- mentioned Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013. Despite generally strong commitment by national 3 authorities to apply legal norms, the scale of the gold boom has dwarfed their capacity to respond. Technical expertise, budget resources, and political capital are concentrated in national entities while regional and local capacity, resources, and political will vary widely. Municipalities are reluctant to undertake enforcement actions that might lose jobs or votes. Although ASGM associations exist, few are as yet capable of offering services to their members or they have limited political clout. In Chocó, the growing presence of illegal mining operations in Afro-Colombian consejos comunitarios, indigenous resguardos, and forest reserves established under Law 2/1959 is destabilizing local governance. Over and above the public policy context per se, the politics surrounding the mining sector raises a difficult conundrum for reform. While most sector stakeholders – from public entities to private mining companies and smaller miners – acknowledge that broad-scale reform of the sector would be advisable, the politics of the mining sector favor maintaining the status quo. This is typified by sustained negative public opinion of the sector by well-organized and vocal civil society groups and rejection of mining in high profile local consultation processes, which has led to a ruling by the Constitutional Court to put such processes in legal limbo (Corte Constitucional, 2018). Social dynamics. Interactions among ASGM operations, regional and national authorities, and larger companies are often conflictive. Numerous stakeholders coexist in an intricate network of formal and informal arrangements, regulations, and traditions. Informal miners’ lack of secure property rights is a traditional obstacle to formalization. Without clear routes to titling, miners are more likely to sell their gold at a significant discount (up to 30 percent below official gold price) on the black market, which is frequently linked to money laundering and leaves miners vulnerable to extortion. Concentrations of male migrant workers in mining areas have resulted in increased prostitution, youth pregnancy, violence against women, and child labor. Although ASGM operators can sometimes be highly organized locally (e.g., the Asociación de Agromineros del Cauca alone has 1,300 members) and the volume of cash in local gold economies is significant, operations cannot access new technology, credit, or legal assistance to institute safer practices and eliminate child labor, mitigate environmental impacts, and secure themselves against illegal groups that threaten to destabilize the country’s peace-building goals. Although there has been positive movement and willingness by larger mining companies to embrace mining formalization and develop ASGM “co- existence” models within their titles, relatively few active private industrial mining companies have been willing to take the leap of entering into binding legalization/formalization agreements with small-scale miners on a large scale. Environmental challenges. Four main impacts are associated with informal and illegal ASGM in Colombia: (i) severe alteration of landscapes, including significant deforestation and associated losses of biodiversity and soil structure; (ii) disruptions to hydrological functions and fragile benthic biology from uncontrolled discharge of sediment into natural drainages and wetlands and alterations of riverbeds and riparian vegetation; (iii) contamination of soil, air, water, and aquatic food chains by 4 discharge of toxic mercury used in the amalgamation process to extract fine gold particles; and (iv) acute and chronic effect to human health from exposure to multiple sources of mercury in contaminated environments. In 2019, it was estimated that 92,000 ha of land and forests have been significantly altered or wholly degraded by mechanized alluvial ASGM in Colombia, with trends accelerating (UNODC, 2018). Impacts from unregulated mining can have repercussions for ecosystems and populations located downstream of mining sites. The impacts from mercury use in ASGM are especially nefarious. Colombia ranks among the top five countries in overall mercury consumption (UNEP, 2015) and is the world’s largest mercury polluter per capita from ASGM (Cordy et al., 2011). It is estimated that in 2012, gold mining by small operators in Colombia released over 200 tons of mercury into the environment (IDEAM, 2014). Although there is no official figure for gaseous emissions of mercury, monitoring airborne mercury that was done over three years in eight municipalities in Antioquia, where most gold buying shops are located, showed concentrations in excess of permissible levels as defined by the World Health Organization (USAID, 2020). Metallic mercury is converted into mobile forms that are inhaled and accumulate along the food chain, concentrating in human tissues and causing a range of health problems from genetic malformations to cancers (Wotruba et.al, 1998). Children and pregnant women are especially at risk. A study of the mercury value chain shows that imports into Colombia decreased from 150 tons per year in 2009 to 104 tons in 2013 (MME, 2014); however, these figures are based on legal imports and exclude all contraband mercury, which is believed to be significant. In the same report, the government identifies 29 “mercury hot spots” located in seven departments (including Antioquia and Chocó) that represent 95 percent of national gold production and concludes that mercury use has remained largely stable. Somewhat more positively, field monitoring of airborne mercury and mercury use at mine sites where the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Legal Gold or “Oro Legal” Activity supports ASGM operators has shown significant reductions in mercury use, particularly by smaller, alluvial operators with the introduction of new practices. A three-fold increase in the price of mercury in areas where ASGM is traditionally undertaken, arising from a significant reduction in legal imports of mercury instituted by the Colombian Ministry of Commerce, is another major factor for the decrease in mercury use by these MPUs (USAID, 2019). 2. Why formalization of the ASGM sector is so critical Mining formalization that clearly defines resource rights, rules, and responsibilities is fundamental to the improvement of the social, environmental, and economic performance of the ASGM subsector and can contribute to broader government goals to consolidate the peace process, transform economies overshadowed by illicit transactions, and make local groups and communities more resilient and self- reliant. As the interest of the Colombian government is to progress towards full legality in the sector with a short-term goal of 60 percent of total gold production derived from titled MPUs by 2022 5 (GOC, 2018), a logical starting point is a clear division between those miners who want to formalize and those who are linked to criminal groups or carry out mining in areas where it is impossible to operate legally, establishing a balance between state control and market incentives. For the former group, the institutional and policy context for ASGM in Colombia is characterized by a complex regulatory framework and onerous bureaucracy with competing agendas and varied perspectives across different sectors and levels of government. For small-scale miners interested in formalizing their activity, overcoming regulatory obstacles is exceedingly costly and fraught with long approval delays that can extend for years or even decades, thus posing significant barriers to entry and disincentives for miners to begin the process. Small-scale miners are clear about these obstacles, as expressed in the words of one miner who took five years to complete the formalization process: \"If it is almost impossible for good miners to formalize in this country, how are we going to stop the bad ones and modernize the sector?\" This is a shrewd and profound observation that should attract the attention of authorities and merits a coherent response. Formalization of the ASGM sector is not only a response to improve the circumstances of many rural areas afflicted by insecurity, instability, and illegality, but is also the first critical step in modernizing the sector and generating significant positive multiplier effects to achieve other goals set by the government´s National Development Plan (GOC, 2018). By way of example, the use, approval, and oversight of rigorous but simpler and less costly Mine Operating Plans (PTOs) and Environmental Impact Studies (EIAs) – the two basic instruments required for formalization of MPUs (referred to here by their Spanish acronyms) – would raise the social, economic, and environmental performance of operators and contribute to higher-level security outcomes and combatting organized crime. Easier accessibility to formalization processes by ASGM operators would trigger an increasing flow of social, economic, and environmental improvements. These include the following: Social development Raising the legitimacy of ASGM operators and the gold mining sector, thus reducing the repercussions from the stigma that ASGM carries vis-à-vis Colombian society and internationally, which cannot be understated. Lower levels of fear and insecurity that permeate the lives of many ASGM families and communities. Eligibility for social benefits, such as accident and disability insurance and enrollment in pension plans. Improved public health with wider access to health services, reduced exposure to mercury, and worker safety measures. Eradication of child labor and higher levels of school enrollment. 6 Broader, more equitable participation and empowerment of women, youth, and ethnic minorities. Rising levels of self-determination and well-being as the corrosive impact on families and communities, as well as fear that is engendered by involvement in illegal or even criminal operations, subsides. Economic development Securing licit economic growth that displaces criminality. Formal, more stable and better paying jobs, which reduces inequality and resentment. Improved incomes as a fuller percentage of gold prices is captured by small operators who extract themselves from the illicit markets and enter restructured, legal markets. Higher levels of productivity with access to new technologies, innovative practices, training programs, technical assistance, and finance as ASGM operators become eligible to enter government vocational and incentive programs like international responsible gold initiatives. Increased revenues to governments from compliance with tax and royalty payments. Possibility for miners to enter international premium markets and thus improve the image of the Colombian mining sector. Possibility to opt out of unsustainable or marginal ASGM by transitioning into alternative licit income-generating activities introduced into rural economies. Environmental management Reduced impact to water, soil, forest resources, and biodiversity with formal mine operating and environmental mitigation plans. Prevention of mercury emissions and accumulation in ecosystems and aquatic food chains affecting wildlife and human health. Mitigation of climate change from land use change and deforestation. Post-mining restoration/reclamation to stabilize mined areas and repair/recover damage to ecological functions and/or socio-economic value. 3. International cooperation: United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) In support of GOC efforts to promote responsible mining, the governments of the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through their respective cooperation programs. USAID’s “Oro Legal” Activity responds to the growing social conflict, environmental impact, and governance challenges arising from the recent gold mining boom in Colombia. The Activity recognizes that uncontrolled ASGM is a stimulus for both illegality and wide-scale environmental degradation, while at the same time leaving large groups of operators vulnerable to extortion by illegal armed groups, which threatens Colombia`s peace-building efforts. In implementing its activities, Oro Legal acts as a 7 “neutral stakeholder,” neither expanding nor reducing mining activity per se, but rather, supporting responsible mining where is it is technically, financially, and legally feasible to do so in close concert with Colombian government entities. Oro Legal is geographically focused in the regions of Antioquia and Chocó and has two main objectives. The first is to build effective governance capacity for legal and formal ASGM activities by working with the GOC to make formalization more accessible by supporting participation of ASGMs in formalization programs with training and technical assistance. Currently, Oro Legal is consolidating a portfolio of 11 mining formalization projects comprising 135 MPUs, with 47 MPUs formalized to date. Almost three tons of legal gold produced by Oro Legal-supported MPUs, generating approximately US$125 million in licit revenue; more than US$9 million in royalties, taxes, and social security payments; and eliminating 45 tons of mercury from the gold production process. The business, technical, and environmental performance of Oro Legal-supported MPUs that have entered the formalization process is steadily improving as measured against baselines, underpinned by technical assistance at mine sites. Several formalized MPUs are on a pathway to enter more rigorous international standards-based programs that offer additional price and financial incentives. The second objective is to reduce the environmental impact caused by illegal mining through restoration of degraded areas and developing alternative livelihoods for mining families that cannot or should not be involved in gold mining. Since 2015, Oro Legal has supported rehabilitation of areas degraded by past illegal mining on almost 17,000 ha in both Antioquia and Chocó. This has been done in collaboration with landowners, Afro-Colombian communities, and municipalities and regional governments, and has been a locally important job-creation engine. In conjunction with tree planting in degraded areas in Antioquia, more than 300 people, many of them women and former subsistence miners, manage 11 honey production projects. As all these hives come into full production, honey production is projected to rise to approximately 400 tons by mid-2020, equal to 12 percent of total national production. In Chocó, 300 families have planted 670 ha of annatto trees that produce seeds from which a natural colorant (bixin) is extracted. Commercial alliances between a new community commercial entity and private companies will position this production for sale in national and international markets. Arising from a wish to improve the situation of ASGM miners, the Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (BGI for ASM) was set up in 2013 as a private-public partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association (SBGA) and the SECO. The initiative relies on the importance of the Swiss market, brings together leading players in the gold sector, and creates sustainable and transparent conditions along the gold value chain. It supports the implementation of a number of international initiatives like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, which guides companies to ensure that their mineral sourcing does not finance 8 conflicts (OECD, 2016). In addition, BGI for ASM supports the implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which aims to minimize mercury emissions. Peru was the first country to implement the BGI for ASM, beginning in 2013. Currently, 3,000 kg of responsibly produced gold from ASGMs are exported from Peru to Switzerland. The initiative offers a market-based premium of US$1,000/kg for responsibly produced ASGM gold. The increasing interest of the ASGM sector and public institutions in BGI for ASM’s approach and the increasing demand for Better Gold by Swiss industry were crucial to expansion of the BGI for ASM program from Peru to Bolivia and Colombia since 2017. In Colombia, BGI for ASM is working with more than 20 small-scale mining operations, mainly in Antioquia, towards compliance with Better Gold criteria. In 2020, the goal is to export 400 kg of responsible gold, mainly from Antioquia ASGM operators, to markets in Switzerland. In addition, BGI for ASM is supporting the subsistence mining sector, gold panners or “barequeros” in Chocó Department. Since 2019, approximately 10 kg of gold/month have been exported to Switzerland by roughly 500 mainly female panners who conform to Better Gold criteria. In Colombia, Oro Legal and SGBA-BGI for ASM have formed a working alliance whereby MPUs that are formalized and demonstrate sufficient improvement with support from Oro Legal can “graduate” into the SBGA Better Gold “escalator” and access legal value chains and Swiss markets with a minimum of intermediation (see Figure 1). 4. Pathways to formalization The starting point for improving performance of the ASGM sector and achieving higher level social, economic, environmental, and security goals is formalization at scale. This is a two-step process: (i) MPUs must have legal title or access to mining areas, and (ii) MPU operations must be fully compliant with applicable laws, regulations, and technical norms. Accomplishing these two steps is juridically, technically, and economically daunting even for more advanced, industrial-scale gold MPUs. During the design and initial work planning phases of Oro Legal in 2015, six viable routes were identified for legalization and formalization of ASGM operators (see Figure 2). As most mining areas are already titled and some 63 percent of ASGM operations do not hold titles, the three most viable, but still complex, routes identified at that time were operating contracts, formalization subcontracts, and devolution of mining areas for subsequent titling by ASGMs. During a pilot program funded by USAID that was a precursor to Oro Legal, support was provided to the then-MME to draft a resolution to regulate the third pathway, “Devolution of Claims for Formalization,” but the instrument was never adopted. Ironically, the “Special Reserve Area” pathway was deemed at that time to have limited possibilities; however, there has been a modest expansion of “Special Reserve Areas” by the National Mining Agency (ANM), although regulations like the total prohibition on the use of mechanized equipment stymy productivity and investment in improving performance. 9 As Figure 2 illustrates, historic and current legislation that underpins pathways to formalization is complex and is supported by an array of often competing laws, decrees, and regulations developed over a long period, responding to the interests of a variety of groups as well as political expediency that ebbs and flows over time. The conundrum, of course, is that while most mining experts and sector stakeholders agree that a new Mining Law would be the best way forward, no one holds any great optimism that it could indeed be negotiated and so, in practice most of them adopt a “better the devil you know” approach, attempting to make the best use of available pathways to move forward, however slow and costly this process often is. In light of evolving GOC mining policy, there has been a shrinking of the “de facto” routes to formalization, which for all intents and purposes are limited to only three: (i) subsistence miners who are able to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year (MME, 2017); (ii) miners who reach civil legal agreements with private titleholders to legally mine on these titles, largely via formalization subcontracts; and (iii) miners who can comply with the criteria to apply for a Special Mining Reserve Area and operate in these areas with approval of the ANM. For most other ASGM operators, the only other effective alternative is to apply for and develop on open, untitled areas a traditional mining title, moving from exploration through to exploitation and ultimately, mine closure. However, in areas such as Antioquia, where 95 percent of the department is either already titled or has permissions for titles “in place,” the probability of finding untitled areas that are commercially viable is very low. Within this context, the demands of compliance with exacting GOC mining and environmental legislation will continue to represent the biggest challenge to more expansive ASGM mining formalization, even via a truncated group of pathways. Again, there is consensus among industry players that mining at all levels generates impacts that should be planned for and adequately managed and mitigated, but the focus on costly and complicated ex-ante mining plans and environmental licenses effectively constitutes an insurmountable barrier for many ASGM operators who want to become formalized. By way of example, and as part of the Activity’s mandate to support ASGM formalization, Oro Legal has had to field a team of 17 technical specialists (including biologists, water engineers, archeologists, and others) to comply with demanding terms of reference for the preparation of EIAs by regional environmental authorities at a cost of roughly US$50,000 per EIA developed. Further, most EIAs take between one to three years to review, frequently generating hundreds of technical observations, which must be fully addressed before approval is granted. Unsurprisingly, given these hurdles, perverse incentives quickly emerge and an institutional desire for exhaustive environmental control ironically results in no environmental control at all. 5. Obstacles to formalization: stakeholder consultations In an effort to move ASGM formalization to the top of the agenda of the then-new administration of President Iván Duque, Oro Legal and BGI for ASM, with support from the United States and Swiss 10 governments, initiated a process to develop practical proposals for the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022, which was then in preparation. This was done through a multi-stakeholder engagement process to identify entry points within the existing legal and institutional framework for concrete improvements to increase formalization of ASGM operators. A series of focus groups was conducted between April and May 2018, including 13 consultations with small-scale gold miners and other sector stakeholders involved in the formalization process in five departments (Antioquia, Chocó, Sur de Bolivar, Santander, and Cauca), and five others with representatives from academia, non- governmental organizations (NGOs), large private mining companies, and government authorities linked to the sector. Interviews and meetings were also conducted with key informants in the MME; MADS; departmental governments, particularly the Mining Secretariat of Antioquia; regional environmental authorities; and local governments, particularly municipalities in Bajo Cauca, Antioquia that shed light on the effect of the competing agendas and perspectives mentioned above, as well as high staff turnover, varying institutional capacity, and political constraints to improving the regulatory framework for formalization (JAA, 2018). During the consultation process, a consensus emerged across stakeholder groups around a number of principal obstacles to ASGM entry into formalization processes, which, taken as a whole, create immense disincentives for these operators to make the investment to do so. These key issues are presented below: Key Issue 1. Disarticulation between policies and legal frameworks and ASGM realities and needs. National mining policies, laws, regulations, and norms across several ministries, agencies, and levels of government create a legal framework that is ill-adapted for ASGM. Disarticulation is particularly acute between the MME, ANM, MADS, and, in the case of Antioquia, the departmental Mining Secretariat. For example, the same comprehensive requirements for EIAs are applied uniformly to all to MPUs regardless of scale, sophistication, equipment used, processing technology, geographic location, ecological factors, or potential environmental footprint. A plethora of competing and incompatible institutional interests and mandates has stymied collaborative processes with miners on rule-setting and enforcement, consideration of ASGM in the context of all actors along the supply chain, experience-sharing, and awareness-raising. This situation is exacerbated by many officials’ limited knowledge of on-the-ground realities and scant field experience, which leads to distinct interpretations of mining, environmental, labor, and other regulations as well as extremely slow approval processes. For example, it has taken the mines that make up the recently approved Special Concessions Contract in Tarazá, Antioquia – which has recently entered the BGI for ASM program – 18 years to work through the governmental approval maze to become formalized. There is a reluctance on the part of authorities to recognize the hard fact that government alone cannot manage or control many thousands of ASGM operators. National and regional mining and environmental authorities are largely absent in the mining areas, further isolating decision-makers from realities in the field and leaving miners and local mayors to go it mostly alone. This rigidity and 11 lack of field presence has stifled alliance-building and exploration of co-management arrangements among all actors – large and small MPUs, upstream and downstream operators – as approaches to improve the regulatory framework, aid the GOC to attain fuller compliance, and foster higher performance in the sector. Key Issue 2. Conditions that favor informality. As in many countries, once legality can be determined, the formalization process in Colombia is wrought with onerous, excessively costly requirements, and lengthy review and approval processes. As noted previously, environmental and technical requirements to operate legally are undifferentiated as to type, size, and location of the MPU. As one ASGM participant put it, “It is not at all the same to do mining in Chocó as in La Guajira and a simple mini-dredge with a small pump operated by two people can’t be compared to operations that use heavy mechanized equipment.” The two main instruments for formalization – PTOs and EIAs – are out of reach for most ASGM operators given their limited organizational and financial capacity to contract and pay for highly specialized technical services to prepare these instruments and subsequently comply with all approved mitigation, monitoring, and operational measures. The cost of preparing the PTO together with the EIA can exceed US$50,000, even for MPUs with a footprint of less than 100 square meters. Except in Special Reserve Areas, regulations prohibit grouping more than one MPU under the same PTO or EIA. As one participant lamented, “It is incomprehensible how the same requirements apply to such vastly different operations. The obligations placed on us small miners scare me.” Further, rigid requirements and an “all-or-nothing” approach for approval of PTOs and EIAs runs counter to the intentions of the government’s 2013 National Formalization Policy that recognized formalization as a process rather than one-off regulatory compliance (Echavarria, C., 2014). ASGM supply chains in Colombia are especially vulnerable to capture by criminal consortia. Remnant FARC elements and the ELN, a lesser known revolutionary left-wing armed group, are still active in many remote mining areas like Chocó, and extort informal/illegal ASGM to finance their operations (DuPée. M. C., 2018). Barriers to legitimate markets and buyers are put up by criminal groups and vested interests that dominate commercial transactions. This is compounded by how, in comparison to other rural sectors, informal ASGM operators have little legitimacy to access legal financial services for formalization and to invest in improved practices. Traditions of ASGM communities are little valued by government and the social and historical roots of traditional miners are little accounted for in granting of mining titles and formalization processes, compared to large companies and individuals with more means. Key Issue 3. Difficulty reconciling ASGM needs and mining titleholder rights. Some larger private sector operators have the perception that it is extremely difficult to engage, negotiate, and reach agreement with ASGM operators on their title and don’t fully appreciate the benefits of making the investment to do so. This is compounded when companies perceive that ASGM formalization is not a priority of the government, judging from its lack of engagement in the process. This is changing as 12 security concerns and illicit economies tied to illegal mining persist and local ASGM operators increasingly organize to express their needs. Also, programs like Oro Legal and BGI for ASM are helpful in their role as honest brokers between parties to guide discussions and legitimize agreements. Key Issue 4. Limited development options for subsistence miners. The GOC recognizes the legitimacy of subsistence mining, typically defined as unmechanized mining that brings together individual gold panners and other rudimentary miners who are allowed to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year. Leaving aside the challenge of illicit stakeholders co-opting these miners to launder illegal gold (there have been several “sting” operations by authorities that have unearthed hundreds of taxi drivers, housewives, bakery workers, etc., all registered as subsistence miners by unscrupulous commercialization outfits, all “selling” their legally permitted limit of 420 grams/year with most having no knowledge that these sales had taken place), there is also a broader development challenge for these miners. In areas such as Istmina in Chocó, where much of the territory remains off-limits to larger-scale mining and dynamic river systems and isolated flood plains offer good conditions for gold panning, the challenge is to help geographically isolated and poorly educated miners avoid exploitation by the plethora of local intermediaries who buy gold for cash at highly discounted prices. Against this backdrop, BGI for ASM has recently launched an innovative project with gold panners in Istmina, Chocó, which has brought 500 subsistence gold panners into an international supply chain. The linchpin of this initiative is application of an internationally recognized due diligence system implemented by an international gold trader based in Colombia. This is done via biometrics, documents, and live video feeds to monitor and control each commercial transaction that can then pass through formal banking channels and allows for full segregation of the gold from the rest of the supply chain. The chain of custody is tightly controlled by reducing the level of intermediation with the Colombia-based international gold trader exporting the segregated gold directly to a Swiss refiner and who then sells on the responsibly produced gold to a renowned Swiss jewelry brand that is a member of SBGA. The mostly female subsistence “barequeros” benefit from this international supply chain by capturing a large percentage of the gold price and an additional SBGA-BGI premium payment. Additionally, this project aims to eradicate child labor in the Chocó region through engagement with a local NGO. In other areas, such as the Bajo Cauca region of Antioquia, extensive alluvial gold mining has significantly reduced the profitability of gold panning, a main livelihood for large numbers of single, female heads of household. These “barequeras” report paltry returns from panning since more accessible, productive areas are usually mined successively by illegal operators using heavy machinery and powerful washing plants. For these subsistence miners, the logical solution is to move out of this highly precarious rung on the ASGM value chain and into an alternative economic activity that offers a decent wage. Oro Legal has worked for several years with this group of miners to address the challenges they face through support to then-nascent honey production in Bajo Cauca for 13 community owned and managed apiaries. The installation of some 11,500 beehives over 11 apiculture projects has allowed more than 300 ex-mining families to earn, on average, 1.5 times the Colombian minimum monthly wage (approximately US$280/month) for a few days of work each week. In the second half of 2019, these apiaries produced about 90 tons of honey, generating US$250,000 in income for these families. This volume is expected to exceed 400 tons by mid-2020. While these returns are unlikely to turn the heads of larger miners, for the thousands for subsistence miners who operate at the lower echelons of the ASGM “value chain,” such alternative livelihoods offer a stable, dignified, and legal economic option to subsistence gold mining. 6. A proposal to expand ASGM formalization: National Unified Formalization Plan (NUFP) The inputs and conclusions of the stakeholder consultation process were analyzed by national and international experts from the two cooperation programs and a consensus emerged for practical proposals to reduce transaction costs of formalization (titling, PTOs, EIAs, monitoring, reporting) and to accompany small-scale miners along this process. The recommendations were presented to the Colombian government jointly by the United States and the Swiss Confederation through their respective embassies. The recommendations are purposely modest in scope with a focus on practical steps that can be implemented by Colombian authorities without entering into a wholesale policy reviews and reforms or promulgation of new laws. The main recommendation is the creation of a National Unified Formalization Plan (NUFP) whose objective is to enable small-scale miners to transition to formality by more closely coordinating functions and procedures of the main government actors involved. This approach is consistent with the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 to lower regulatory requirements and raise productivity of the private sector and that of the OECD, of which Colombia became the 37th member in 2018. The proposal for a NUFP is built on six pillars: 1. Differentiated approach. In recognition of the conditions, challenges, and opportunities faced by ASGM operators and their relationship with large companies, separate categories should be defined for ASGM and the concept of “traditional mining” reassessed. This would be the starting point for distinguishing between criminal mining operations and miners who want and are eligible to enter a formalization process with differentiated regulatory instruments and procedures tailored to the conditions of small operators. This approach has a dual purpose in allowing the government to transition a greater number of mines into the formal economy, while better targeting its law enforcement efforts on mining operations that are wholly criminal. 2. Simplification of procedures and processes. A single, one-stop shop or window for formalization of small-scale mining operators would be created based on: (i) aligning the requirements and review of mine operational and environmental instruments to the scale of production and on-the-ground footprint; (ii) reasonable and firm guidelines and response times for authorities to review and approve environmental and operational instruments; (iii) decentralization of several key 14 functions of the ANM to the department level; and (iv) issuance of required Mineral Commercialization Permits according to the selected formalization pathway, be it through designation of mining areas for specific recipients (Special Mining Reserve Areas, new titles), application for a mining concession contract, or under an operations contract for ASGM located in areas already titled to large companies. 3. Effective articulation between institutions at national and local levels. The NUFP would define a coordination strategy and procedures between the MME, MADS, ANM, law enforcement agencies, and Regional Autonomous Corporations (departmental environmental authorities) with the objective of empowering local actors and decentralizing regulatory authority, especially in those regions with important ASGM sectors. More effective coordination would also contribute to solidifying the legitimacy of the State in these regions, many of which are located in post-conflict areas. 4. Accompaniment in the formalization process. As pillars 1 – 3 are adopted, small-scale miners who enter the formalization process will need support across several fronts. Technical assistance and training will be required to mitigate environmental impacts and increase productivity and serve as an incentive. This would be delivered through a network of accredited technical advisors with experience in formalization processes and creation of “ASGM service centers” through public-private partnerships. Access to banking and financial services needs to be opened to small-scale miners and a point-of-sale for gold established that offers transparent transactions based on international prices and on internally accepted due diligence processes as an alternative to illegal markets and buyers. Finally, the financial incentives to transition small-scale miners to zero-mercury and cleaner technologies provided for under the current Mercury Law and in compliance with Colombia’s obligations as a signatory to the Minamata Convention should be made operational. 5. Livelihood alternatives to subsistence. Given how many artisanal and small-scale gold miners struggle to eke out a living at the subsistence level, frequently operating in inhospitable and precarious working conditions, the NUFP would act as an articulating mechanism with other relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture, departmental governments, municipalities) to develop alternative livelihood options for vulnerable miners who are looking for an exit ramp out of the sector. Since such options would contribute to reducing illegality and negative externalities in the mining sector, it would be logical and justified to allocate funding through transfers from centrally managed mining royalties and directly engage the private mining sector actors. It is interesting that Mineros SA, a gold mining company that operates in the municipality of El Bagre, Antioquia, already has a successful program to produce honey as well as natural latex from rubber plantations on formally mined land, which can serve as a model for a broader alternative livelihood initiative with support from other mining companies. 6. Permanent dialogue. Open, continuous dialogue is critical to the success of the NUFP. The stakeholder dialogue spaces supported by Oro Legal and BGI for ASM that led to the proposal for a NUFP should be made permanent and be expanded to the national level and to those departments 15 where ASGM is most prevalent. There is a precedent for such fora in the Mining Roundtable for Chocó, which is principally a government initiative. If meaningful alliance-building is to take root to create conditions that favor formality and overall performance change in the ASGM sector, all concerned parties will need to have an equal voice. Such a modality will be the first step towards a co- management framework whereby informal ASGM is delinked from criminality and the Colombian government can count on an increasing number of formalized ASGM allies to strengthen governance and compliance in the sector. Acknowledgments The authors wish to recognize the invaluable collaboration of government of Colombia counterparts and ASGM, private sector, and other partners in our joint efforts to improve the performance of ASGM in Colombia and its contribution to national development. To this end, the wealth of knowledge and experience and progress achieved by the Oro Legal Activity and Better Gold Initiative would not have been possible without the support of the United States Agency for International Development and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, respectively. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to our field teams for the dedication, creativity, and resourcefulness they consistently demonstrate in carrying out their work.

Routes to Legalization and Formalization in Colombia Formalization subcontract Regulated by Decree 480 under Law 1658/2013. Four-year agreement between mining titleholder and ASM with consent of mining authorities. ASM may exploit parts of concession where titleholder is in exploration phase. ASM must formalize and comply with regulations, including submission of a modified PTO and EIA. Responsibility passes from the titleholder to ASM operator subject to inspection by authorities. Benefits include use of land for alluvial mining without restricting titleholder’s ability to later conduct hard rock mining. Four-year agreement guarantees stability for miners to formalize. Operating contract Voluntary agreement between titleholder and illegal operators on titled area without need for mining authority’s approval. Titleholder retains responsibility for environmental compliance, providing an incentive to work closely with ASMs in good management. Devolution of claims for formalization Prescribed under Article 11 of Law 1658/2013. However, corresponding regulation not yet finalized. When regulated, will allow titleholder to return portion of concession to government for reassignment to pre-identified ASMs already working in the area. Cession of claims Prescribed under Article 25 of the Mining Code. Titleholder can divide the concession and transfer sections to new titleholders along with all legal rights and obligations. Not commonly used as original titleholder has no recourse to later reclaim ceded titles. Concession in free areas Title obtained and legalization process undertaken in untitled areas. Theoretically straightforward, utilization of route hampered by overlapping claims, incomplete mining and cadastral records, red tape, and limited existence of unclaimed areas. Special reserve area Contemplated under Law 685/2001. Traditional mining group or GOC can initiate process, provided there are no third-party claim applications or titles. The government must conduct necessary geological and mining surveys. Source: USAID, Oro Legal Activity'"

      "As the government of Colombia consolidates post-conflict conditions, the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through the “Oro Legal” Activity of the United States Agency for International Development and “Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining,” a public-private partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A consultative process with a broad array of stakeholder groups yielded consensus on the principal obstacles to ASGM formalization, which create serious disincentives to entry into this process.\n",

      "\n",
      "Context and problem statement\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent administrations of Colombia have highlighted the importance of legality, pointing to the mining sector as a particular area of interest for national development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Colombia, gold mining is one of the principle extractive industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important economic activity in many rural areas and has a long tradition in Colombian history and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASGM is an increasingly prevalent informal economic activity, typical of countries with weak institutional capacity to adequately control and regulate the sector (Hilson, 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "In Colombia, this is compounded by a long period of internal conflict where the State was absent from many areas, especially in more rural, isolated ones where ASGM is typically concentrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Colombian context, small-scale mining operations2 correspond to 94 percent of total gold mining operations nationwide, of which 60 percent are untitled operations that are considered illegal and, in many cases, finance organized crime (UNODC, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial incomes from gold mining and the ease of operating informally have attracted more than 500,000 Colombians to this activity since this type of mining is relatively accessible and often the only livelihood option available for vulnerable populations (Hentschel et al., 2002).\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the last Mining Census, conducted in 2011/2012,3 of the 14,357 mining production units (MPUs) recorded, 4,133 MPUs produce gold and account for 90 percent of MPUs that produce precious minerals in Colombia (MME, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the magnitude of this activity, only 13.3 percent of MPUs are legally titled, with 87 percent or 3,584 gold MPUs classified as informal or illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the spike in gold prices between 2010 and 2013 and the subsequent rise in prices over the last 18 months, the number of informal and illegal gold MPUs has undoubtedly increased significantly since the last Mining Census, exacerbating issues surrounding ASGM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold mining is a fast-growing source of revenue for the government of Colombia (GOC) and a pillar of many local economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere is this truer than in northern Antioquia and along the San Juan and Atrato rivers in Chocó on Colombia’s Pacific coast, which account for 70 percent of ASGM in Colombia (SIMCO, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Both departments have been gold-mining regions since pre-colonial times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenues from illegal gold mining in Colombia are difficult to measure because of the “leakage” of illegal gold sold into illicit markets and how illegal gold production is “laundered” into 1\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors’ views expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the government of Colombia, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) or United States government, or Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development (SECO) or the government of Switzerland.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper draws on a study on formalization of artisanal and small gold mining commissioned by the USAID Oro Legal Activity and SECO Better Gold Initiative, the recommendations from which were presented to the government of Colombia.\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Decree 1666 of 2016, the Ministry of Mines and Energy defines small-scale gold mining as operations occupying up to 150 ha in the exploration or pre-production phase or extract up to 15,000 tons of ore annually for underground mines and no more than 250,000 m3/year of ore for alluvial mining.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Mining Census includes extractive activities for both precious and non-precious minerals and construction materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 legal gold markets in Colombia.\n",
      "\n",
      "By one estimate, gold mining generated approximately US$2.4 billion in revenues, or three times the amount generated from trafficking cocaine produced in Colombia, with exports registered at US$1.78 billion (ANM, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Like cocaine, illegal mining poses a litany of security, governance, social, and environmental challenges (DuPée, M. C., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Security challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as providing a livelihood for many marginal rural families, informal or illegal gold mining also finances illegal groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of violent competitors vying for these gold riches is a window into Colombia’s various social fault lines and conflicts: National Liberation Army, or ELN, a leftist guerilla group that comprises approximately 2,000 combatants; El Clan del Golfo, a criminal syndicate; a 1990s-era paramilitary group known as United Self Defense Forces of Colombia or AUC; and former members of the defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a response, the Colombian government has ramped up enforcement with several task forces and campaigns that have disrupted numerous operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Task Force Titan eliminated a massive illegal mining operation in Chocó organized by the Clan del Golfo, destroying more than $4.2 million of heavy machinery and other contraband (DuPée, M. C., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these high-profile victories against illegal actors, interdiction efforts impact a small fraction of overall production in the sector, demonstrating how any approach to improve current policy will involve at least as much “carrot” as “stick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this specific juncture, with the backdrop of consolidating the historic peace agreement with the FARC while, at the same time, addressing other security threats and organized crime groups, the challenge facing the GOC and other stakeholders in the gold mining sector is how to exploit the undoubted potential that gold mining offers in a legal, responsible way, while working to strengthen governance and the rule of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance capacity in the gold mining sector is highly centralized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Colombia’s 32 regional governments, only Antioquia enjoys delegated authority for the sector with role of municipalities restricted to local enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) has a solid legislative platform to underpin change, but specific opportunities for better regulation remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, incentives under Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013 and regulation of Article 248 of Law 685/2001 to expand pathways for legalization/formalization have not materialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "National entities are generally well-resourced, but regional and local capacity varies – for example, Antioquia department has a functioning mining secretariat, but regional entities in Chocó department do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is strong demand from departments and municipalities for decentralization of authorities and decision-making (Echavarria, C., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance must be understood in its broadest context, extending from the government to ASGM operations and mining associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the MME and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS) have a large set of legislative and regulatory tools, these have not translated into better control, management, or on-the-ground performance by MPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, credit facilities have yet to be created for legal miners to eliminate mercury use, per the above- mentioned Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite generally strong commitment by national 3 authorities to apply legal norms, the scale of the gold boom has dwarfed their capacity to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical expertise, budget resources, and political capital are concentrated in national entities while regional and local capacity, resources, and political will vary widely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Municipalities are reluctant to undertake enforcement actions that might lose jobs or votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although ASGM associations exist, few are as yet capable of offering services to their members or they have limited political clout.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chocó, the growing presence of illegal mining operations in Afro-Colombian consejos comunitarios, indigenous resguardos, and forest reserves established under Law 2/1959 is destabilizing local governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over and above the public policy context per se, the politics surrounding the mining sector raises a difficult conundrum for reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "While most sector stakeholders – from public entities to private mining companies and smaller miners – acknowledge that broad-scale reform of the sector would be advisable, the politics of the mining sector favor maintaining the status quo.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is typified by sustained negative public opinion of the sector by well-organized and vocal civil society groups and rejection of mining in high profile local consultation processes, which has led to a ruling by the Constitutional Court to put such processes in legal limbo (Corte Constitucional, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Social dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interactions among ASGM operations, regional and national authorities, and larger companies are often conflictive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous stakeholders coexist in an intricate network of formal and informal arrangements, regulations, and traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Informal miners’ lack of secure property rights is a traditional obstacle to formalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without clear routes to titling, miners are more likely to sell their gold at a significant discount (up to 30 percent below official gold price) on the black market, which is frequently linked to money laundering and leaves miners vulnerable to extortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concentrations of male migrant workers in mining areas have resulted in increased prostitution, youth pregnancy, violence against women, and child labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although ASGM operators can sometimes be highly organized locally (e.g., the Asociación de Agromineros del Cauca alone has 1,300 members) and the volume of cash in local gold economies is significant, operations cannot access new technology, credit, or legal assistance to institute safer practices and eliminate child labor, mitigate environmental impacts, and secure themselves against illegal groups that threaten to destabilize the country’s peace-building goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there has been positive movement and willingness by larger mining companies to embrace mining formalization and develop ASGM “co- existence” models within their titles, relatively few active private industrial mining companies have been willing to take the leap of entering into binding legalization/formalization agreements with small-scale miners on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four main impacts are associated with informal and illegal ASGM in Colombia: (i) severe alteration of landscapes, including significant deforestation and associated losses of biodiversity and soil structure; (ii) disruptions to hydrological functions and fragile benthic biology from uncontrolled discharge of sediment into natural drainages and wetlands and alterations of riverbeds and riparian vegetation; (iii) contamination of soil, air, water, and aquatic food chains by 4 discharge of toxic mercury used in the amalgamation process to extract fine gold particles; and (iv) acute and chronic effect to human health from exposure to multiple sources of mercury in contaminated environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, it was estimated that 92,000 ha of land and forests have been significantly altered or wholly degraded by mechanized alluvial ASGM in Colombia, with trends accelerating (UNODC, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Impacts from unregulated mining can have repercussions for ecosystems and populations located downstream of mining sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impacts from mercury use in ASGM are especially nefarious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colombia ranks among the top five countries in overall mercury consumption (UNEP, 2015) and is the world’s largest mercury polluter per capita from ASGM\n",
      "\n",
      "(Cordy et al., 2011).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is estimated that in 2012, gold mining by small operators in Colombia released over 200 tons of mercury into the environment (IDEAM, 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there is no official figure for gaseous emissions of mercury, monitoring airborne mercury that was done over three years in eight municipalities in Antioquia, where most gold buying shops are located, showed concentrations in excess of permissible levels as defined by the World Health Organization (USAID, 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "Metallic mercury is converted into mobile forms that are inhaled and accumulate along the food chain, concentrating in human tissues and causing a range of health problems from genetic malformations to cancers (Wotruba et.al, 1998).\n",
      "\n",
      "Children and pregnant women are especially at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study of the mercury value chain shows that imports into Colombia decreased from 150 tons per year in 2009 to 104 tons in 2013 (MME, 2014); however, these figures are based on legal imports and exclude all contraband mercury, which is believed to be significant.\n",
      "\n",

      "Legal Gold or “Oro Legal” Activity supports ASGM operators has shown significant reductions in mercury use, particularly by smaller, alluvial operators with the introduction of new practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "A three-fold increase in the price of mercury in areas where ASGM is traditionally undertaken, arising from a significant reduction in legal imports of mercury instituted by the Colombian Ministry of Commerce, is another major factor for the decrease in mercury use by these MPUs (USAID, 2019).\n",

      "Why formalization of the ASGM sector is so critical Mining formalization that clearly defines resource rights, rules, and responsibilities is fundamental to the improvement of the social, environmental, and economic performance of the ASGM subsector and can contribute to broader government goals to consolidate the peace process, transform economies overshadowed by illicit transactions, and make local groups and communities more resilient and self- reliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the interest of the Colombian government is to progress towards full legality in the sector with a short-term goal of 60 percent of total gold production derived from titled MPUs by 2022 5 (GOC, 2018), a logical starting point is a clear division between those miners who want to formalize and those who are linked to criminal groups or carry out mining in areas where it is impossible to operate legally, establishing a balance between state control and market incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the former group, the institutional and policy context for ASGM in Colombia is characterized by a complex regulatory framework and onerous bureaucracy with competing agendas and varied perspectives across different sectors and levels of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "For small-scale miners interested in formalizing their activity, overcoming regulatory obstacles is exceedingly costly and fraught with long approval delays that can extend for years or even decades, thus posing significant barriers to entry and disincentives for miners to begin the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-scale miners are clear about these obstacles, as expressed in the words of one miner who took five years to complete the formalization process: \"If it is almost impossible for good miners to formalize in this country, how are we going to stop the bad ones and modernize the sector?\n",
      "\n",
      "\" This is a shrewd and profound observation that should attract the attention of authorities and merits a coherent response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formalization of the ASGM sector is not only a response to improve the circumstances of many rural areas afflicted by insecurity, instability, and illegality, but is also the first critical step in modernizing the sector and generating significant positive multiplier effects to achieve other goals set by the government´s National Development Plan (GOC, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of example, the use, approval, and oversight of rigorous but simpler and less costly Mine Operating Plans (PTOs) and Environmental Impact Studies (EIAs) – the two basic instruments required for formalization of MPUs (referred to here by their Spanish acronyms) – would raise the social, economic, and environmental performance of operators and contribute to higher-level security outcomes and combatting organized crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easier accessibility to formalization processes by ASGM operators would trigger an increasing flow of social, economic, and environmental improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include the following: Social development Raising the legitimacy of ASGM operators and the gold mining sector, thus reducing the repercussions from the stigma that ASGM carries vis-à-vis Colombian society and internationally, which cannot be understated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower levels of fear and insecurity that permeate the lives of many ASGM families and communities.\n",

      "Several formalized MPUs are on a pathway to enter more rigorous international standards-based programs that offer additional price and financial incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second objective is to reduce the environmental impact caused by illegal mining through restoration of degraded areas and developing alternative livelihoods for mining families that cannot or should not be involved in gold mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2015, Oro Legal has supported rehabilitation of areas degraded by past illegal mining on almost 17,000 ha in both Antioquia and Chocó.\n",

      "Pathways to formalization The starting point for improving performance of the ASGM sector and achieving higher level social, economic, environmental, and security goals is formalization at scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a two-step process: (i) MPUs must have legal title or access to mining areas, and (ii)\n",
      "\n",
      "MPU operations must be fully compliant with applicable laws, regulations, and technical norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accomplishing these two steps is juridically, technically, and economically daunting even for more advanced, industrial-scale gold MPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the design and initial work planning phases of Oro Legal in 2015, six viable routes were identified for legalization and formalization of ASGM operators (see Figure 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "As most mining areas are already titled and some 63 percent of ASGM operations do not hold titles, the three most viable, but still complex, routes identified at that time were operating contracts, formalization subcontracts, and devolution of mining areas for subsequent titling by ASGMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a pilot program funded by USAID that was a precursor to Oro Legal, support was provided to the then-MME to draft a resolution to regulate the third pathway, “Devolution of Claims for Formalization,” but the instrument was never adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, the “Special Reserve Area” pathway was deemed at that time to have limited possibilities; however, there has been a modest expansion of “Special Reserve Areas” by the National Mining Agency (ANM), although regulations like the total prohibition on the use of mechanized equipment stymy productivity and investment in improving performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "\n",
      "As Figure 2 illustrates, historic and current legislation that underpins pathways to formalization is complex and is supported by an array of often competing laws, decrees, and regulations developed over a long period, responding to the interests of a variety of groups as well as political expediency that ebbs and flows over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conundrum, of course, is that while most mining experts and sector stakeholders agree that a new Mining Law would be the best way forward, no one holds any great optimism that it could indeed be negotiated and so, in practice most of them adopt a “better the devil you know” approach, attempting to make the best use of available pathways to move forward, however slow and costly this process often is.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of evolving GOC mining policy, there has been a shrinking of the “de facto” routes to formalization, which for all intents and purposes are limited to only three: (i)\n",
      "\n",
      "subsistence miners who are able to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year (MME, 2017); (ii) miners who reach civil legal agreements with private titleholders to legally mine on these titles, largely via formalization subcontracts; and (iii) miners who can comply with the criteria to apply for a Special Mining Reserve Area and operate in these areas with approval of the ANM.\n",
      "\n",
      "For most other ASGM operators, the only other effective alternative is to apply for and develop on open, untitled areas a traditional mining title, moving from exploration through to exploitation and ultimately, mine closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in areas such as Antioquia, where 95 percent of the department is either already titled or has permissions for titles “in place,” the probability of finding untitled areas that are commercially viable is very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within this context, the demands of compliance with exacting GOC mining and environmental legislation will continue to represent the biggest challenge to more expansive ASGM mining formalization, even via a truncated group of pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, there is consensus among industry players that mining at all levels generates impacts that should be planned for and adequately managed and mitigated, but the focus on costly and complicated ex-ante mining plans and environmental licenses effectively constitutes an insurmountable barrier for many ASGM operators who want to become formalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of example, and as part of the Activity’s mandate to support ASGM formalization, Oro Legal has had to field a team of 17 technical specialists (including biologists, water engineers, archeologists, and others) to comply with demanding terms of reference for the preparation of EIAs by regional environmental authorities at a cost of roughly US$50,000 per EIA developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, most EIAs take between one to three years to review, frequently generating hundreds of technical observations, which must be fully addressed before approval is granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, given these hurdles, perverse incentives quickly emerge and an institutional desire for exhaustive environmental control ironically results in no environmental control at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obstacles to formalization: stakeholder consultations In an effort to move ASGM formalization to the top of the agenda of the then-new administration of President Iván Duque, Oro Legal and BGI for ASM, with support from the United States and Swiss 10 governments, initiated a process to develop practical proposals for the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022, which was then in preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was done through a multi-stakeholder engagement process to identify entry points within the existing legal and institutional framework for concrete improvements to increase formalization of ASGM operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of focus groups was conducted between April and May 2018, including 13 consultations with small-scale gold miners and other sector stakeholders involved in the formalization process in five departments (Antioquia, Chocó, Sur de Bolivar, Santander, and Cauca), and five others with representatives from academia, non- governmental organizations (NGOs), large private mining companies, and government authorities linked to the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviews and meetings were also conducted with key informants in the MME; MADS; departmental governments, particularly the Mining Secretariat of Antioquia; regional environmental authorities; and local governments, particularly municipalities in Bajo Cauca, Antioquia that shed light on the effect of the competing agendas and perspectives mentioned above, as well as high staff turnover, varying institutional capacity, and political constraints to improving the regulatory framework for formalization (JAA, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "During the consultation process, a consensus emerged across stakeholder groups around a number of principal obstacles to ASGM entry into formalization processes, which, taken as a whole, create immense disincentives for these operators to make the investment to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "These key issues are presented below: Key Issue 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disarticulation between policies and legal frameworks and ASGM realities and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "National mining policies, laws, regulations, and norms across several ministries, agencies, and levels of government create a legal framework that is ill-adapted for ASGM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disarticulation is particularly acute between the MME, ANM, MADS, and, in the case of Antioquia, the departmental Mining Secretariat.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the same comprehensive requirements for EIAs are applied uniformly to all to MPUs regardless of scale, sophistication, equipment used, processing technology, geographic location, ecological factors, or potential environmental footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "A plethora of competing and incompatible institutional interests and mandates has stymied collaborative processes with miners on rule-setting and enforcement, consideration of ASGM in the context of all actors along the supply chain, experience-sharing, and awareness-raising.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation is exacerbated by many officials’ limited knowledge of on-the-ground realities and scant field experience, which leads to distinct interpretations of mining, environmental, labor, and other regulations as well as extremely slow approval processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, it has taken the mines that make up the recently approved Special Concessions Contract in Tarazá, Antioquia – which has recently entered the BGI for ASM program – 18 years to work through the governmental approval maze to become formalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a reluctance on the part of authorities to recognize the hard fact that government alone cannot manage or control many thousands of ASGM operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "National and regional mining and environmental authorities are largely absent in the mining areas, further isolating decision-makers from realities in the field and leaving miners and local mayors to go it mostly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rigidity and 11 lack of field presence has stifled alliance-building and exploration of co-management arrangements among all actors – large and small MPUs, upstream and downstream operators – as approaches to improve the regulatory framework, aid the GOC to attain fuller compliance, and foster higher performance in the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Issue 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions that favor informality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in many countries, once legality can be determined, the formalization process in Colombia is wrought with\n",
      "\n",
      "onerous, excessively costly requirements, and lengthy review and approval processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted previously, environmental and technical requirements to operate legally are undifferentiated as to type, size, and location of the MPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one ASGM participant put it, “It is not at all the same to do mining in Chocó as in La Guajira and a simple mini-dredge with a small pump operated by two people can’t be compared to operations that use heavy mechanized equipment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main instruments for formalization – PTOs and EIAs – are out of reach for most ASGM operators given their limited organizational and financial capacity to contract and pay for highly specialized technical services to prepare these instruments and subsequently comply with all approved mitigation, monitoring, and operational measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of preparing the PTO together with the EIA can exceed US$50,000, even for MPUs with a footprint of less than 100 square meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except in Special Reserve Areas, regulations prohibit grouping more than one MPU under the same PTO or EIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one participant lamented, “It is incomprehensible how the same requirements apply to such vastly different operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obligations placed on us small miners scare me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, rigid requirements and an “all-or-nothing” approach for approval of PTOs and EIAs runs counter to the intentions of the government’s 2013 National Formalization Policy that recognized formalization as a process rather than one-off regulatory compliance (Echavarria, C., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "ASGM supply chains in Colombia are especially vulnerable to capture by criminal consortia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remnant FARC elements and the ELN, a lesser known revolutionary left-wing armed group, are still active in many remote mining areas like Chocó, and extort informal/illegal ASGM to finance their operations (DuPée. M. C., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Barriers to legitimate markets and buyers are put up by criminal groups and vested interests that dominate commercial transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is compounded by how, in comparison to other rural sectors, informal ASGM operators have little legitimacy to access legal financial services for formalization and to invest in improved practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditions of ASGM communities are little valued by government and the social and historical roots of traditional miners are little accounted for in granting of mining titles and formalization processes, compared to large companies and individuals with more means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Issue 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Difficulty reconciling ASGM needs and mining titleholder rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some larger private sector operators have the perception that it is extremely difficult to engage, negotiate, and reach agreement with ASGM operators on their title and don’t fully appreciate the benefits of making the investment to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is compounded when companies perceive that ASGM formalization is not a priority of the government, judging from its lack of engagement in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is changing as 12 security concerns and illicit economies tied to illegal mining persist and local ASGM operators increasingly organize to express their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, programs like Oro Legal and BGI for ASM are helpful in their role as honest brokers between parties to guide discussions and legitimize agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Issue 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limited development options for subsistence miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GOC recognizes the legitimacy of subsistence mining, typically defined as unmechanized mining that brings together individual gold panners and other rudimentary miners who are allowed to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving aside the challenge of illicit stakeholders co-opting these miners to launder illegal gold (there have been several “sting” operations by authorities that have unearthed hundreds of taxi drivers, housewives, bakery workers, etc., all registered as subsistence miners by unscrupulous commercialization outfits, all “selling” their legally permitted limit of 420 grams/year with most having no knowledge that these sales had taken place), there is also a broader development challenge for these miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "In areas such as Istmina in Chocó, where much of the territory remains off-limits to larger-scale mining and dynamic river systems and isolated flood plains offer good conditions for gold panning, the challenge is to help geographically isolated and poorly educated miners avoid exploitation by the plethora of local intermediaries who buy gold for cash at highly discounted prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against this backdrop, BGI for ASM has recently launched an innovative project with gold panners in Istmina, Chocó, which has brought 500 subsistence gold panners into an international supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The linchpin of this initiative is application of an internationally recognized due diligence system implemented by an international gold trader based in Colombia.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is done via biometrics, documents, and live video feeds to monitor and control each commercial transaction that can then pass through formal banking channels and allows for full segregation of the gold from the rest of the supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chain of custody is tightly controlled by reducing the level of intermediation with the Colombia-based international gold trader exporting the segregated gold directly to a Swiss refiner and who then sells on the responsibly produced gold to a renowned Swiss jewelry brand that is a member of SBGA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mostly female subsistence “barequeros” benefit from this international supply chain by capturing a large percentage of the gold price and an additional SBGA-BGI premium payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this project aims to eradicate child labor in the Chocó region through engagement with a local NGO.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other areas, such as the Bajo Cauca region of Antioquia, extensive alluvial gold mining has significantly reduced the profitability of gold panning, a main livelihood for large numbers of single, female heads of household.\n",
      "\n",
      "These “barequeras” report paltry returns from panning since more accessible, productive areas are usually mined successively by illegal operators using heavy machinery and powerful washing plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these subsistence miners, the logical solution is to move out of this highly precarious rung on the ASGM value chain and into an alternative economic activity that offers a decent wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oro Legal has worked for several years with this group of miners to address the challenges they face through support to then-nascent honey production in Bajo Cauca for 13 community owned and managed apiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation of some 11,500 beehives over 11 apiculture projects has allowed more than 300 ex-mining families to earn, on average, 1.5 times the Colombian minimum monthly wage (approximately US$280/month) for a few days of work each week.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second half of 2019, these apiaries produced about 90 tons of honey, generating US$250,000 in income for these families.\n",
      "\n",
      "This volume is expected to exceed 400 tons by mid-2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these returns are unlikely to turn the heads of larger miners, for the thousands for subsistence miners who operate at the lower echelons of the ASGM “value chain,” such alternative livelihoods offer a stable, dignified, and legal economic option to subsistence gold mining.\n",

      "A proposal to expand ASGM formalization: National Unified Formalization Plan (NUFP)\n",
      "\n",
      "The inputs and conclusions of the stakeholder consultation process were analyzed by national and international experts from the two cooperation programs and a consensus emerged for practical proposals to reduce transaction costs of formalization (titling, PTOs, EIAs, monitoring, reporting) and to accompany small-scale miners along this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendations were presented to the Colombian government jointly by the United States and the Swiss Confederation through their respective embassies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendations are purposely modest in scope with a focus on practical steps that can be implemented by Colombian authorities without entering into a wholesale policy reviews and reforms or promulgation of new laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main recommendation is the creation of a National Unified Formalization Plan (NUFP) whose objective is to enable small-scale miners to transition to formality by more closely coordinating functions and procedures of the main government actors involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is consistent with the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 to lower regulatory requirements and raise productivity of the private sector and that of the OECD, of which Colombia became the 37th member in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal for a NUFP is built on six pillars: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differentiated approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recognition of the conditions, challenges, and opportunities faced by ASGM operators and their relationship with large companies, separate categories should be defined for ASGM and the concept of “traditional mining” reassessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would be the starting point for distinguishing between criminal mining operations and miners who want and are eligible to enter a formalization process with differentiated regulatory instruments and procedures tailored to the conditions of small operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach has a dual purpose in allowing the government to transition a greater number of mines into the formal economy, while better targeting its law enforcement efforts on mining operations that are wholly criminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplification of procedures and processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single, one-stop shop or window for formalization of small-scale mining operators would be created based on: (i) aligning the requirements and review of mine operational and environmental instruments to the scale of production and on-the-ground footprint; (ii) reasonable and firm guidelines and response times for authorities to review and approve environmental and operational instruments; (iii) decentralization of several key 14 functions of the ANM to the department level; and (iv) issuance of required Mineral Commercialization Permits according to the selected formalization pathway, be it through designation of mining areas for specific recipients (Special Mining Reserve Areas, new titles), application for a mining concession contract, or under an operations contract for ASGM located in areas already titled to large companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effective articulation between institutions at national and local levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NUFP would define a coordination strategy and procedures between the MME, MADS, ANM, law enforcement agencies, and Regional Autonomous Corporations (departmental environmental authorities) with the objective of empowering local actors and decentralizing regulatory authority, especially in those regions with important ASGM sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "More effective coordination would also contribute to solidifying the legitimacy of the State in these regions, many of which are located in post-conflict areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accompaniment in the formalization process.\n",
      "\n",
      "As pillars 1 – 3 are adopted, small-scale miners who enter the formalization process will need support across several fronts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical assistance and training will be required to mitigate environmental impacts and increase productivity and serve as an incentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would be delivered through a network of accredited technical advisors with experience in formalization processes and creation of “ASGM service centers” through public-private partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to banking and financial services needs to be opened to small-scale miners and a point-of-sale for gold established that offers transparent transactions based on international prices and on internally accepted due diligence processes as an alternative to illegal markets and buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the financial incentives to transition small-scale miners to zero-mercury and cleaner technologies provided for under the current Mercury Law and in compliance with Colombia’s obligations as a signatory to the Minamata Convention should be made operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Livelihood alternatives to subsistence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given how many artisanal and small-scale gold miners struggle to eke out a living at the subsistence level, frequently operating in inhospitable and precarious working conditions, the NUFP would act as an articulating mechanism with other relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture, departmental governments, municipalities) to develop alternative livelihood options for vulnerable miners who are looking for an exit ramp out of the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since such options would contribute to reducing illegality and negative externalities in the mining sector, it would be logical and justified to allocate funding through transfers from centrally managed mining royalties and directly engage the private mining sector actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting that Mineros SA, a gold mining company that operates in the municipality of El Bagre, Antioquia, already has a successful program to produce honey as well as natural latex from rubber plantations on formally mined land, which can serve as a model for a broader alternative livelihood initiative with support from other mining companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Permanent dialogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open, continuous dialogue is critical to the success of the NUFP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stakeholder dialogue spaces supported by Oro Legal and BGI for ASM that led to the proposal for a NUFP should be made permanent and be expanded to the national level and to those departments 15 where ASGM is most prevalent.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a precedent for such fora in the Mining Roundtable for Chocó, which is principally a government initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "If meaningful alliance-building is to take root to create conditions that favor formality and overall performance change in the ASGM sector, all concerned parties will need to have an equal voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a modality will be the first step towards a co- management framework whereby informal ASGM is delinked from criminality and the Colombian government can count on an increasing number of formalized ASGM allies to strengthen governance and compliance in the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acknowledgments The authors wish to recognize the invaluable collaboration of government of Colombia counterparts and ASGM, private sector, and other partners in our joint efforts to improve the performance of ASGM in Colombia and its contribution to national development.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, the wealth of knowledge and experience and progress achieved by the Oro Legal Activity and Better Gold Initiative would not have been possible without the support of the United States Agency for International Development and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "High rates of informality undermine governance, security, and legal economies, and cause significant environmental and social impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the government of Colombia consolidates post-conflict conditions, the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through the “Oro Legal” Activity of the United States Agency for International Development and “Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining,” a public-private partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A consultative process with a broad array of stakeholder groups yielded consensus on the principal obstacles to ASGM formalization, which create serious disincentives to entry into this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enable ASGM operators to transition to formality, a recommendation emerged for a National Unified Formalization Plan, which rests on six proposals that largely align with current policy and legislation.\n",

      "Key Words: Artisanal and small gold mining, formalization, governance, environmental impact, security 1 Formalization of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in Colombia: A Proposal for Improving Environmental, Social, and Economic Performance in a Post-Conflict Scenario1 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent administrations of Colombia have highlighted the importance of legality, pointing to the mining sector as a particular area of interest for national development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Colombia, gold mining is one of the principle extractive industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important economic activity in many rural areas and has a long tradition in Colombian history and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASGM is an increasingly prevalent informal economic activity, typical of countries with weak institutional capacity to adequately control and regulate the sector (Hilson, 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "In Colombia, this is compounded by a long period of internal conflict where the State was absent from many areas, especially in more rural, isolated ones where ASGM is typically concentrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Colombian context, small-scale mining operations2 correspond to 94 percent of total gold mining operations nationwide, of which 60 percent are untitled operations that are considered illegal and, in many cases, finance organized crime (UNODC, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial incomes from gold mining and the ease of operating informally have attracted more than 500,000 Colombians to this activity since this type of mining is relatively accessible and often the only livelihood option available for vulnerable populations (Hentschel et al., 2002).\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the last Mining Census, conducted in 2011/2012,3 of the 14,357 mining production units (MPUs) recorded, 4,133 MPUs produce gold and account for 90 percent of MPUs that produce precious minerals in Colombia (MME, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the magnitude of this activity, only 13.3 percent of MPUs are legally titled, with 87 percent or 3,584 gold MPUs classified as informal or illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the spike in gold prices between 2010 and 2013 and the subsequent rise in prices over the last 18 months, the number of informal and illegal gold MPUs has undoubtedly increased significantly since the last Mining Census, exacerbating issues surrounding ASGM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold mining is a fast-growing source of revenue for the government of Colombia (GOC) and a pillar of many local economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere is this truer than in northern Antioquia and along the San Juan and Atrato rivers in Chocó on Colombia’s Pacific coast, which account for 70 percent of ASGM in Colombia (SIMCO, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Both departments have been gold-mining regions since pre-colonial times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenues from illegal gold mining in Colombia are difficult to measure because of the “leakage” of illegal gold sold into illicit markets and how illegal gold production is “laundered” into 1\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors’ views expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the government of Colombia, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) or United States government, or Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development (SECO) or the government of Switzerland.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper draws on a study on formalization of artisanal and small gold mining commissioned by the USAID Oro Legal Activity and SECO Better Gold Initiative, the recommendations from which were presented to the government of Colombia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Decree 1666 of 2016, the Ministry of Mines and Energy defines small-scale gold mining as operations occupying up to 150 ha in the exploration or pre-production phase or extract up to 15,000 tons of ore annually for underground mines and no more than 250,000 m3/year of ore for alluvial mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mining Census includes extractive activities for both precious and non-precious minerals and construction materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "By one estimate, gold mining generated approximately US$2.4 billion in revenues, or three times the amount generated from trafficking cocaine produced in Colombia, with exports registered at US$1.78 billion (ANM, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Like cocaine, illegal mining poses a litany of security, governance, social, and environmental challenges (DuPée, M. C., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Security challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as providing a livelihood for many marginal rural families, informal or illegal gold mining also finances illegal groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of violent competitors vying for these gold riches is a window into Colombia’s various social fault lines and conflicts: National Liberation Army, or ELN, a leftist guerilla group that comprises approximately 2,000 combatants; El Clan del Golfo, a criminal syndicate; a 1990s-era paramilitary group known as United Self Defense Forces of Colombia or AUC; and former members of the defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a response, the Colombian government has ramped up enforcement with several task forces and campaigns that have disrupted numerous operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Task Force Titan eliminated a massive illegal mining operation in Chocó organized by the Clan del Golfo, destroying more than $4.2 million of heavy machinery and other contraband (DuPée, M. C., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these high-profile victories against illegal actors, interdiction efforts impact a small fraction of overall production in the sector, demonstrating how any approach to improve current policy will involve at least as much “carrot” as “stick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this specific juncture, with the backdrop of consolidating the historic peace agreement with the FARC while, at the same time, addressing other security threats and organized crime groups, the challenge facing the GOC and other stakeholders in the gold mining sector is how to exploit the undoubted potential that gold mining offers in a legal, responsible way, while working to strengthen governance and the rule of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance capacity in the gold mining sector is highly centralized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Colombia’s 32 regional governments, only Antioquia enjoys delegated authority for the sector with role of municipalities restricted to local enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) has a solid legislative platform to underpin change, but specific opportunities for better regulation remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, incentives under Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013 and regulation of Article 248 of Law 685/2001 to expand pathways for legalization/formalization have not materialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "National entities are generally well-resourced, but regional and local capacity varies – for example, Antioquia department has a functioning mining secretariat, but regional entities in Chocó department do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is strong demand from departments and municipalities for decentralization of authorities and decision-making (Echavarria, C., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance must be understood in its broadest context, extending from the government to ASGM operations and mining associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the MME and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS) have a large set of legislative and regulatory tools, these have not translated into better control, management, or on-the-ground performance by MPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, credit facilities have yet to be created for legal miners to eliminate mercury use, per the above- mentioned Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite generally strong commitment by national 3 authorities to apply legal norms, the scale of the gold boom has dwarfed their capacity to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical expertise, budget resources, and political capital are concentrated in national entities while regional and local capacity, resources, and political will vary widely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Municipalities are reluctant to undertake enforcement actions that might lose jobs or votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although ASGM associations exist, few are as yet capable of offering services to their members or they have limited political clout.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chocó, the growing presence of illegal mining operations in Afro-Colombian consejos comunitarios, indigenous resguardos, and forest reserves established under Law 2/1959 is destabilizing local governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over and above the public policy context per se, the politics surrounding the mining sector raises a difficult conundrum for reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "While most sector stakeholders – from public entities to private mining companies and smaller miners – acknowledge that broad-scale reform of the sector would be advisable, the politics of the mining sector favor maintaining the status quo.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is typified by sustained negative public opinion of the sector by well-organized and vocal civil society groups and rejection of mining in high profile local consultation processes, which has led to a ruling by the Constitutional Court to put such processes in legal limbo (Corte Constitucional, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Interactions among ASGM operations, regional and national authorities, and larger companies are often conflictive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous stakeholders coexist in an intricate network of formal and informal arrangements, regulations, and traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Informal miners’ lack of secure property rights is a traditional obstacle to formalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without clear routes to titling, miners are more likely to sell their gold at a significant discount (up to 30 percent below official gold price) on the black market, which is frequently linked to money laundering and leaves miners vulnerable to extortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concentrations of male migrant workers in mining areas have resulted in increased prostitution, youth pregnancy, violence against women, and child labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although ASGM operators can sometimes be highly organized locally (e.g., the Asociación de Agromineros del Cauca alone has 1,300 members) and the volume of cash in local gold economies is significant, operations cannot access new technology, credit, or legal assistance to institute safer practices and eliminate child labor, mitigate environmental impacts, and secure themselves against illegal groups that threaten to destabilize the country’s peace-building goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there has been positive movement and willingness by larger mining companies to embrace mining formalization and develop ASGM “co- existence” models within their titles, relatively few active private industrial mining companies have been willing to take the leap of entering into binding legalization/formalization agreements with small-scale miners on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four main impacts are associated with informal and illegal ASGM in Colombia: (i) severe alteration of landscapes, including significant deforestation and associated losses of biodiversity and soil structure; (ii) disruptions to hydrological functions and fragile benthic biology from uncontrolled discharge of sediment into natural drainages and wetlands and alterations of riverbeds and riparian vegetation; (iii) contamination of soil, air, water, and aquatic food chains by 4 discharge of toxic mercury used in the amalgamation process to extract fine gold particles; and (iv) acute and chronic effect to human health from exposure to multiple sources of mercury in contaminated environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, it was estimated that 92,000 ha of land and forests have been significantly altered or wholly degraded by mechanized alluvial ASGM in Colombia, with trends accelerating (UNODC, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "Impacts from unregulated mining can have repercussions for ecosystems and populations located downstream of mining sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impacts from mercury use in ASGM are especially nefarious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colombia ranks among the top five countries in overall mercury consumption (UNEP, 2015) and is the world’s largest mercury polluter per capita from ASGM\n",
      "\n",
      "It is estimated that in 2012, gold mining by small operators in Colombia released over 200 tons of mercury into the environment (IDEAM, 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there is no official figure for gaseous emissions of mercury, monitoring airborne mercury that was done over three years in eight municipalities in Antioquia, where most gold buying shops are located, showed concentrations in excess of permissible levels as defined by the World Health Organization (USAID, 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "Metallic mercury is converted into mobile forms that are inhaled and accumulate along the food chain, concentrating in human tissues and causing a range of health problems from genetic malformations to cancers (Wotruba et.al, 1998).\n",
      "\n",
      "Children and pregnant women are especially at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study of the mercury value chain shows that imports into Colombia decreased from 150 tons per year in 2009 to 104 tons in 2013 (MME, 2014); however, these figures are based on legal imports and exclude all contraband mercury, which is believed to be significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same report, the government identifies 29 “mercury hot spots” located in seven departments (including Antioquia and Chocó) that represent 95 percent of national gold production and concludes that mercury use has remained largely stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal Gold or “Oro Legal” Activity supports ASGM operators has shown significant reductions in mercury use, particularly by smaller, alluvial operators with the introduction of new practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "A three-fold increase in the price of mercury in areas where ASGM is traditionally undertaken, arising from a significant reduction in legal imports of mercury instituted by the Colombian Ministry of Commerce, is another major factor for the decrease in mercury use by these MPUs (USAID, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "Why formalization of the ASGM sector is so critical Mining formalization that clearly defines resource rights, rules, and responsibilities is fundamental to the improvement of the social, environmental, and economic performance of the ASGM subsector and can contribute to broader government goals to consolidate the peace process, transform economies overshadowed by illicit transactions, and make local groups and communities more resilient and self- reliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the interest of the Colombian government is to progress towards full legality in the sector with a short-term goal of 60 percent of total gold production derived from titled MPUs by 2022 5 (GOC, 2018), a logical starting point is a clear division between those miners who want to formalize and those who are linked to criminal groups or carry out mining in areas where it is impossible to operate legally, establishing a balance between state control and market incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the former group, the institutional and policy context for ASGM in Colombia is characterized by a complex regulatory framework and onerous bureaucracy with competing agendas and varied perspectives across different sectors and levels of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "For small-scale miners interested in formalizing their activity, overcoming regulatory obstacles is exceedingly costly and fraught with long approval delays that can extend for years or even decades, thus posing significant barriers to entry and disincentives for miners to begin the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-scale miners are clear about these obstacles, as expressed in the words of one miner who took five years to complete the formalization process: \"If it is almost impossible for good miners to formalize in this country, how are we going to stop the bad ones and modernize the sector?\n",
      "\n",
      "\" This is a shrewd and profound observation that should attract the attention of authorities and merits a coherent response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formalization of the ASGM sector is not only a response to improve the circumstances of many rural areas afflicted by insecurity, instability, and illegality, but is also the first critical step in modernizing the sector and generating significant positive multiplier effects to achieve other goals set by the government´s National Development Plan (GOC, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of example, the use, approval, and oversight of rigorous but simpler and less costly Mine Operating Plans (PTOs) and Environmental Impact Studies (EIAs) – the two basic instruments required for formalization of MPUs (referred to here by their Spanish acronyms) – would raise the social, economic, and environmental performance of operators and contribute to higher-level security outcomes and combatting organized crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easier accessibility to formalization processes by ASGM operators would trigger an increasing flow of social, economic, and environmental improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include the following: Social development Raising the legitimacy of ASGM operators and the gold mining sector, thus reducing the repercussions from the stigma that ASGM carries vis-à-vis Colombian society and internationally, which cannot be understated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower levels of fear and insecurity that permeate the lives of many ASGM families and communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved public health with wider access to health services, reduced exposure to mercury, and worker safety measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rising levels of self-determination and well-being as the corrosive impact on families and communities, as well as fear that is engendered by involvement in illegal or even criminal operations, subsides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic development Securing licit economic growth that displaces criminality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formal, more stable and better paying jobs, which reduces inequality and resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved incomes as a fuller percentage of gold prices is captured by small operators who extract themselves from the illicit markets and enter restructured, legal markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher levels of productivity with access to new technologies, innovative practices, training programs, technical assistance, and finance as ASGM operators become eligible to enter government vocational and incentive programs like international responsible gold initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased revenues to governments from compliance with tax and royalty payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibility for miners to enter international premium markets and thus improve the image of the Colombian mining sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibility to opt out of unsustainable or marginal ASGM by transitioning into alternative licit income-generating activities introduced into rural economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental management Reduced impact to water, soil, forest resources, and biodiversity with formal mine operating and environmental mitigation plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention of mercury emissions and accumulation in ecosystems and aquatic food chains affecting wildlife and human health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post-mining restoration/reclamation to stabilize mined areas and repair/recover damage to ecological functions and/or socio-economic value.\n",
      "\n",
      "In support of GOC efforts to promote responsible mining, the governments of the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through their respective cooperation programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "USAID’s “Oro Legal” Activity responds to the growing social conflict, environmental impact, and governance challenges arising from the recent gold mining boom in Colombia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Activity recognizes that uncontrolled ASGM is a stimulus for both illegality and wide-scale environmental degradation, while at the same time leaving large groups of operators vulnerable to extortion by illegal armed groups, which threatens Colombia`s peace-building efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In implementing its activities, Oro Legal acts as a 7 “neutral stakeholder,” neither expanding nor reducing mining activity per se, but rather, supporting responsible mining where is\n",
      "\n",
      "it is technically, financially, and legally feasible to do so in close concert with Colombian government entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oro Legal is geographically focused in the regions of Antioquia and Chocó and has two main objectives.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Pathways to formalization The starting point for improving performance of the ASGM sector and achieving higher level social, economic, environmental, and security goals is formalization at scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a two-step process: (i) MPUs must have legal title or access to mining areas, and (ii)\n",
      "\n",
      "MPU operations must be fully compliant with applicable laws, regulations, and technical norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accomplishing these two steps is juridically, technically, and economically daunting even for more advanced, industrial-scale gold MPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the design and initial work planning phases of Oro Legal in 2015, six viable routes were identified for legalization and formalization of ASGM operators (see Figure 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "As most mining areas are already titled and some 63 percent of ASGM operations do not hold titles, the three most viable, but still complex, routes identified at that time were operating contracts, formalization subcontracts, and devolution of mining areas for subsequent titling by ASGMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a pilot program funded by USAID that was a precursor to Oro Legal, support was provided to the then-MME to draft a resolution to regulate the third pathway, “Devolution of Claims for Formalization,” but the instrument was never adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, the “Special Reserve Area” pathway was deemed at that time to have limited possibilities; however, there has been a modest expansion of “Special Reserve Areas” by the National Mining Agency (ANM), although regulations like the total prohibition on the use of mechanized equipment stymy productivity and investment in improving performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Figure 2 illustrates, historic and current legislation that underpins pathways to formalization is complex and is supported by an array of often competing laws, decrees, and regulations developed over a long period, responding to the interests of a variety of groups as well as political expediency that ebbs and flows over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conundrum, of course, is that while most mining experts and sector stakeholders agree that a new Mining Law would be the best way forward, no one holds any great optimism that it could indeed be negotiated and so, in practice most of them adopt a “better the devil you know” approach, attempting to make the best use of available pathways to move forward, however slow and costly this process often is.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of evolving GOC mining policy, there has been a shrinking of the “de facto” routes to formalization, which for all intents and purposes are limited to only three: (i)\n",
      "\n",
      "subsistence miners who are able to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year (MME, 2017); (ii) miners who reach civil legal agreements with private titleholders to legally mine on these titles, largely via formalization subcontracts; and (iii) miners who can comply with the criteria to apply for a Special Mining Reserve Area and operate in these areas with approval of the ANM.\n",
      "\n",
      "For most other ASGM operators, the only other effective alternative is to apply for and develop on open, untitled areas a traditional mining title, moving from exploration through to exploitation and ultimately, mine closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in areas such as Antioquia, where 95 percent of the department is either already titled or has permissions for titles “in place,” the probability of finding untitled areas that are commercially viable is very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within this context, the demands of compliance with exacting GOC mining and environmental legislation will continue to represent the biggest challenge to more expansive ASGM mining formalization, even via a truncated group of pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, there is consensus among industry players that mining at all levels generates impacts that should be planned for and adequately managed and mitigated, but the focus on costly and complicated ex-ante mining plans and environmental licenses effectively constitutes an insurmountable barrier for many ASGM operators who want to become formalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of example, and as part of the Activity’s mandate to support ASGM formalization, Oro Legal has had to field a team of 17 technical specialists (including biologists, water engineers, archeologists, and others) to comply with demanding terms of reference for the preparation of EIAs by regional environmental authorities at a cost of roughly US$50,000 per EIA developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, most EIAs take between one to three years to review, frequently generating hundreds of technical observations, which must be fully addressed before approval is granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, given these hurdles, perverse incentives quickly emerge and an institutional desire for exhaustive environmental control ironically results in no environmental control at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obstacles to formalization: stakeholder consultations In an effort to move ASGM formalization to the top of the agenda of the then-new administration of President Iván Duque, Oro Legal and BGI for ASM, with support from the United States and Swiss 10 governments, initiated a process to develop practical proposals for the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022, which was then in preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was done through a multi-stakeholder engagement process to identify entry points within the existing legal and institutional framework for concrete improvements to increase formalization of ASGM operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of focus groups was conducted between April and May 2018, including 13 consultations with small-scale gold miners and other sector stakeholders involved in the formalization process in five departments (Antioquia, Chocó, Sur de Bolivar, Santander, and Cauca), and five others with representatives from academia, non- governmental organizations (NGOs), large private mining companies, and government authorities linked to the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviews and meetings were also conducted with key informants in the MME; MADS; departmental governments, particularly the Mining Secretariat of Antioquia; regional environmental authorities; and local governments, particularly municipalities in Bajo Cauca, Antioquia that shed light on the effect of the competing agendas and perspectives mentioned above, as well as high staff turnover, varying institutional capacity, and political constraints to improving the regulatory framework for formalization (JAA, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "During the consultation process, a consensus emerged across stakeholder groups around a number of principal obstacles to ASGM entry into formalization processes, which, taken as a whole, create immense disincentives for these operators to make the investment to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "These key issues are presented below: Key Issue 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "National mining policies, laws, regulations, and norms across several ministries, agencies, and levels of government create a legal framework that is ill-adapted for ASGM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disarticulation is particularly acute between the MME, ANM, MADS, and, in the case of Antioquia, the departmental Mining Secretariat.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the same comprehensive requirements for EIAs are applied uniformly to all to MPUs regardless of scale, sophistication, equipment used, processing technology, geographic location, ecological factors, or potential environmental footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "A plethora of competing and incompatible institutional interests and mandates has stymied collaborative processes with miners on rule-setting and enforcement, consideration of ASGM in the context of all actors along the supply chain, experience-sharing, and awareness-raising.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation is exacerbated by many officials’ limited knowledge of on-the-ground realities and scant field experience, which leads to distinct interpretations of mining, environmental, labor, and other regulations as well as extremely slow approval processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, it has taken the mines that make up the recently approved Special Concessions Contract in Tarazá, Antioquia – which has recently entered the BGI for ASM program – 18 years to work through the governmental approval maze to become formalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a reluctance on the part of authorities to recognize the hard fact that government alone cannot manage or control many thousands of ASGM operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "National and regional mining and environmental authorities are largely absent in the mining areas, further isolating decision-makers from realities in the field and leaving miners and local mayors to go it mostly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rigidity and 11 lack of field presence has stifled alliance-building and exploration of co-management arrangements among all actors – large and small MPUs, upstream and downstream operators – as approaches to improve the regulatory framework, aid the GOC to attain fuller compliance, and foster higher performance in the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions that favor informality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in many countries, once legality can be determined, the formalization process in Colombia is wrought with\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted previously, environmental and technical requirements to operate legally are undifferentiated as to type, size, and location of the MPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one ASGM participant put it, “It is not at all the same to do mining in Chocó as in La Guajira and a simple mini-dredge with a small pump operated by two people can’t be compared to operations that use heavy mechanized equipment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main instruments for formalization – PTOs and EIAs – are out of reach for most ASGM operators given their limited organizational and financial capacity to contract and pay for highly specialized technical services to prepare these instruments and subsequently comply with all approved mitigation, monitoring, and operational measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of preparing the PTO together with the EIA can exceed US$50,000, even for MPUs with a footprint of less than 100 square meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except in Special Reserve Areas, regulations prohibit grouping more than one MPU under the same PTO or EIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one participant lamented, “It is incomprehensible how the same requirements apply to such vastly different operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, rigid requirements and an “all-or-nothing” approach for approval of PTOs and EIAs runs counter to the intentions of the government’s 2013 National Formalization Policy that recognized formalization as a process rather than one-off regulatory compliance (Echavarria, C., 2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "ASGM supply chains in Colombia are especially vulnerable to capture by criminal consortia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remnant FARC elements and the ELN, a lesser known revolutionary left-wing armed group, are still active in many remote mining areas like Chocó, and extort informal/illegal ASGM to finance their operations (DuPée. M. C., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is compounded by how, in comparison to other rural sectors, informal ASGM operators have little legitimacy to access legal financial services for formalization and to invest in improved practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditions of ASGM communities are little valued by government and the social and historical roots of traditional miners are little accounted for in granting of mining titles and formalization processes, compared to large companies and individuals with more means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Difficulty reconciling ASGM needs and mining titleholder rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some larger private sector operators have the perception that it is extremely difficult to engage, negotiate, and reach agreement with ASGM operators on their title and don’t fully appreciate the benefits of making the investment to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is compounded when companies perceive that ASGM formalization is not a priority of the government, judging from its lack of engagement in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is changing as 12 security concerns and illicit economies tied to illegal mining persist and local ASGM operators increasingly organize to express their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, programs like Oro Legal and BGI for ASM are helpful in their role as honest brokers between parties to guide discussions and legitimize agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GOC recognizes the legitimacy of subsistence mining, typically defined as unmechanized mining that brings together individual gold panners and other rudimentary miners who are allowed to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving aside the challenge of illicit stakeholders co-opting these miners to launder illegal gold (there have been several “sting” operations by authorities that have unearthed hundreds of taxi drivers, housewives, bakery workers, etc., all registered as subsistence miners by unscrupulous commercialization outfits, all “selling” their legally permitted limit of 420 grams/year with most having no knowledge that these sales had taken place), there is also a broader development challenge for these miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "In areas such as Istmina in Chocó, where much of the territory remains off-limits to larger-scale mining and dynamic river systems and isolated flood plains offer good conditions for gold panning, the challenge is to help geographically isolated and poorly educated miners avoid exploitation by the plethora of local intermediaries who buy gold for cash at highly discounted prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against this backdrop, BGI for ASM has recently launched an innovative project with gold panners in Istmina, Chocó, which has brought 500 subsistence gold panners into an international supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The linchpin of this initiative is application of an internationally recognized due diligence system implemented by an international gold trader based in Colombia.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is done via biometrics, documents, and live video feeds to monitor and control each commercial transaction that can then pass through formal banking channels and allows for full segregation of the gold from the rest of the supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chain of custody is tightly controlled by reducing the level of intermediation with the Colombia-based international gold trader exporting the segregated gold directly to a Swiss refiner and who then sells on the responsibly produced gold to a renowned Swiss jewelry brand that is a member of SBGA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mostly female subsistence “barequeros” benefit from this international supply chain by capturing a large percentage of the gold price and an additional SBGA-BGI premium payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this project aims to eradicate child labor in the Chocó region through engagement with a local NGO.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other areas, such as the Bajo Cauca region of Antioquia, extensive alluvial gold mining has significantly reduced the profitability of gold panning, a main livelihood for large numbers of single, female heads of household.\n",
      "\n",
      "These “barequeras” report paltry returns from panning since more accessible, productive areas are usually mined successively by illegal operators using heavy machinery and powerful washing plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these subsistence miners, the logical solution is to move out of this highly precarious rung on the ASGM value chain and into an alternative economic activity that offers a decent wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oro Legal has worked for several years with this group of miners to address the challenges they face through support to then-nascent honey production in Bajo Cauca for 13 community owned and managed apiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation of some 11,500 beehives over 11 apiculture projects has allowed more than 300 ex-mining families to earn, on average, 1.5 times the Colombian minimum monthly wage (approximately US$280/month) for a few days of work each week.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second half of 2019, these apiaries produced about 90 tons of honey, generating US$250,000 in income for these families.\n",
      "\n",
      "This volume is expected to exceed 400 tons by mid-2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these returns are unlikely to turn the heads of larger miners, for the thousands for subsistence miners who operate at the lower echelons of the ASGM “value chain,” such alternative livelihoods offer a stable, dignified, and legal economic option to subsistence gold mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "A proposal to expand ASGM formalization: National Unified Formalization Plan (NUFP)\n",
      "\n",
      "The inputs and conclusions of the stakeholder consultation process were analyzed by national and international experts from the two cooperation programs and a consensus emerged for practical proposals to reduce transaction costs of formalization (titling, PTOs, EIAs, monitoring, reporting) and to accompany small-scale miners along this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendations were presented to the Colombian government jointly by the United States and the Swiss Confederation through their respective embassies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendations are purposely modest in scope with a focus on practical steps that can be implemented by Colombian authorities without entering into a wholesale policy reviews and reforms or promulgation of new laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main recommendation is the creation of a National Unified Formalization Plan (NUFP) whose objective is to enable small-scale miners to transition to formality by more closely coordinating functions and procedures of the main government actors involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is consistent with the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 to lower regulatory requirements and raise productivity of the private sector and that of the OECD, of which Colombia became the 37th member in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal for a NUFP is built on six pillars: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recognition of the conditions, challenges, and opportunities faced by ASGM operators and their relationship with large companies, separate categories should be defined for ASGM and the concept of “traditional mining” reassessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would be the starting point for distinguishing between criminal mining operations and miners who want and are eligible to enter a formalization process with differentiated regulatory instruments and procedures tailored to the conditions of small operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach has a dual purpose in allowing the government to transition a greater number of mines into the formal economy, while better targeting its law enforcement efforts on mining operations that are wholly criminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single, one-stop shop or window for formalization of small-scale mining operators would be created based on: (i) aligning the requirements and review of mine operational and environmental instruments to the scale of production and on-the-ground footprint; (ii) reasonable and firm guidelines and response times for authorities to review and approve environmental and operational instruments; (iii) decentralization of several key 14 functions of the ANM to the department level; and (iv) issuance of required Mineral Commercialization Permits according to the selected formalization pathway, be it through designation of mining areas for specific recipients (Special Mining Reserve Areas, new titles), application for a mining concession contract, or under an operations contract for ASGM located in areas already titled to large companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NUFP would define a coordination strategy and procedures between the MME, MADS, ANM, law enforcement agencies, and Regional Autonomous Corporations (departmental environmental authorities) with the objective of empowering local actors and decentralizing regulatory authority, especially in those regions with important ASGM sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "More effective coordination would also contribute to solidifying the legitimacy of the State in these regions, many of which are located in post-conflict areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "As pillars 1 – 3 are adopted, small-scale miners who enter the formalization process will need support across several fronts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical assistance and training will be required to mitigate environmental impacts and increase productivity and serve as an incentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would be delivered through a network of accredited technical advisors with experience in formalization processes and creation of “ASGM service centers” through public-private partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to banking and financial services needs to be opened to small-scale miners and a point-of-sale for gold established that offers transparent transactions based on international prices and on internally accepted due diligence processes as an alternative to illegal markets and buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the financial incentives to transition small-scale miners to zero-mercury and cleaner technologies provided for under the current Mercury Law and in compliance with Colombia’s obligations as a signatory to the Minamata Convention should be made operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "Livelihood alternatives to subsistence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given how many artisanal and small-scale gold miners struggle to eke out a living at the subsistence level, frequently operating in inhospitable and precarious working conditions, the NUFP would act as an articulating mechanism with other relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture, departmental governments, municipalities) to develop alternative livelihood options for vulnerable miners who are looking for an exit ramp out of the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since such options would contribute to reducing illegality and negative externalities in the mining sector, it would be logical and justified to allocate funding through transfers from centrally managed mining royalties and directly engage the private mining sector actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting that Mineros SA, a gold mining company that operates in the municipality of El Bagre, Antioquia, already has a successful program to produce honey as well as natural latex from rubber plantations on formally mined land, which can serve as a model for a broader alternative livelihood initiative with support from other mining companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open, continuous dialogue is critical to the success of the NUFP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stakeholder dialogue spaces supported by Oro Legal and BGI for ASM that led to the proposal for a NUFP should be made permanent and be expanded to the national level and to those departments 15 where ASGM is most prevalent.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a precedent for such fora in the Mining Roundtable for Chocó, which is principally a government initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "If meaningful alliance-building is to take root to create conditions that favor formality and overall performance change in the ASGM sector, all concerned parties will need to have an equal voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a modality will be the first step towards a co- management framework whereby informal ASGM is delinked from criminality and the Colombian government can count on an increasing number of formalized ASGM allies to strengthen governance and compliance in the sector.\n",

Abstract Artisanal and small - scale gold mining ( and small-scale gold mining ) is an important economic activity in many rural areas , with a long tradition in Colombia . High rates of informality undermine governance , security , and legal economies , and cause significant environmental and social impacts . As the government of Colombia consolidates post - conflict conditions , the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through the “ Oro Legal ” Activity of the United States Agency for International Development and “ Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small - Scale Mining , ” a public - private partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs . A consultative process with a broad array of stakeholder groups yielded consensus on the principal obstacles to and small-scale gold mining formalization , which create serious disincentives to entry into this process . To enable and small-scale gold mining operators to transition to formality , a recommendation emerged for a National Unified Formalization Plan , which rests on six proposals that largely align with current policy and legislation . Key Words : Artisanal and small gold mining , formalization , governance , environmental impact , security 1 Formalization of Artisanal and Small - Scale Gold Mining in Colombia : A Proposal for Improving Environmental , Social , and Economic Performance in a Post - Conflict Scenario1 1 . Context and problem statement Recent administrations of Colombia have highlighted the importance of legality , pointing to the mining sector as a particular area of interest for national development . In Colombia , gold mining is one of the principle extractive industries . Artisanal and small - scale gold mining ( and small-scale gold mining ) is an important economic activity in many rural areas and has a long tradition in Colombian history and culture . and small-scale gold mining is an increasingly prevalent informal economic activity , typical of countries with weak institutional capacity to adequately control and regulate the sector ( Hilson , 2009 ) . In Colombia , this is compounded by a long period of internal conflict where the State was absent from many areas , especially in more rural , isolated ones where and small-scale gold mining is typically concentrated . In the Colombian context , small - scale mining operations2 correspond to 94 percent of total gold mining operations nationwide , of which 60 percent are untitled operations that are considered illegal and , in many cases , finance organized crime ( United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime , 2018 ) . Substantial incomes from gold mining and the ease of operating informally have attracted more than 500,000 Colombians to this activity since this type of mining is relatively accessible and often the only livelihood option available for vulnerable populations ( Hentschel et al . , 2002 ) . According to the last Mining Census , conducted in 2011/2012,3 of the 14,357 mining production units ( mining production units ) recorded , 4,133 mining production units produce gold and account for 90 percent of mining production units that produce precious minerals in Colombia ( Ministry of Mines and Energy , 2012 ) . Despite the magnitude of this activity , only 13.3 percent of mining production units are legally titled , with 87 percent or 3,584 gold mining production units classified as informal or illegal . With the spike in gold prices between 2010 and 2013 and the subsequent rise in prices over the last 18 months , the number of informal and illegal gold mining production units has undoubtedly increased significantly since the last Mining Census , exacerbating issues surrounding and small-scale gold mining . Gold mining is a fast - growing source of revenue for the government of Colombia ( government of Colombia ) and a pillar of many local economies . Nowhere is this truer than in northern Antioquia and along the San Juan and Atrato rivers in Chocó on Colombia ’s Pacific coast , which account for 70 percent of and small-scale gold mining in Colombia ( SIMCO , 2017 ) . Both departments have been gold - mining regions since pre - colonial times . Revenues from illegal gold mining in Colombia are difficult to measure because of the “ leakage ” of illegal gold sold into illicit markets and how illegal gold production is “ laundered ” into 1 The authors ’ views expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the government of Colombia , United States Agency for International Development ( United States Agency for International Development ) or United States government , or Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development ( Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development ) or the government of Switzerland . This paper draws on a study on formalization of artisanal and small gold mining commissioned by the United States Agency for International Development Oro Legal Activity and Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development Better Gold Initiative , the recommendations from which were presented to the government of Colombia . 2 Under Decree 1666 of 2016 , the Ministry of Mines and Energy defines small - scale gold mining as operations occupying up to 150 ha in the exploration or pre - production phase or extract up to 15,000 tons of ore annually for underground mines and no more than 250,000 m3 / year of ore for alluvial mining . 3 The Mining Census includes extractive activities for both precious and non - precious minerals and construction materials . 2 legal gold markets in Colombia . By one estimate , gold mining generated approximately US$ 2.4 billion in revenues , or three times the amount generated from trafficking cocaine produced in Colombia , with exports registered at US$ 1.78 billion ( ANM , 2018 ) . Like cocaine , illegal mining poses a litany of security , governance , social , and environmental challenges ( DuPée , M. C. , 2018 ) . Security challenges . As well as providing a livelihood for many marginal rural families , informal or illegal gold mining also finances illegal groups . The list of violent competitors vying for these gold riches is a window into Colombia ’s various social fault lines and conflicts : National Liberation Army , or ELN , a leftist guerilla group that comprises approximately 2,000 combatants ; El Clan del Golfo , a criminal syndicate ; a 1990s - era paramilitary group known as United Self Defense Forces of Colombia or AUC ; and former members of the defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC . As a response , the Colombian government has ramped up enforcement with several task forces and campaigns that have disrupted numerous operations . In 2017 , Task Force Titan eliminated a massive illegal mining operation in Chocó organized by the Clan del Golfo , destroying more than $ 4.2 million of heavy machinery and other contraband ( DuPée , M. C. , 2018 ) . Despite these high - profile victories against illegal actors , interdiction efforts impact a small fraction of overall production in the sector , demonstrating how any approach to improve current policy will involve at least as much “ carrot ” as “ stick . ” At this specific juncture , with the backdrop of consolidating the historic peace agreement with the FARC while , at the same time , addressing other security threats and organized crime groups , the challenge facing the government of Colombia and other stakeholders in the gold mining sector is how to exploit the undoubted potential that gold mining offers in a legal , responsible way , while working to strengthen governance and the rule of law . Governance . Governance capacity in the gold mining sector is highly centralized . Of Colombia ’s 32 regional governments , only Antioquia enjoys delegated authority for the sector with role of municipalities restricted to local enforcement . The Ministry of Mines and Energy ( Ministry of Mines and Energy ) has a solid legislative platform to underpin change , but specific opportunities for better regulation remain . For example , incentives under Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013 and regulation of Article 248 of Law 685/2001 to expand pathways for legalization / formalization have not materialized . National entities are generally well - resourced , but regional and local capacity varies – for example , Antioquia department has a functioning mining secretariat , but regional entities in Chocó department do not . There is strong demand from departments and municipalities for decentralization of authorities and decision - making ( Echavarria , C. , 2014 ) . Governance must be understood in its broadest context , extending from the government to and small-scale gold mining operations and mining associations . Although the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development ( Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development ) have a large set of legislative and regulatory tools , these have not translated into better control , management , or on - the - ground performance by mining production units . For instance , credit facilities have yet to be created for legal miners to eliminate mercury use , per the above- mentioned Article 10 of Mercury Law 1658/2013 . Despite generally strong commitment by national 3 authorities to apply legal norms , the scale of the gold boom has dwarfed their capacity to respond . Technical expertise , budget resources , and political capital are concentrated in national entities while regional and local capacity , resources , and political will vary widely . Municipalities are reluctant to undertake enforcement actions that might lose jobs or votes . Although and small-scale gold mining associations exist , few are as yet capable of offering services to their members or they have limited political clout . In Chocó , the growing presence of illegal mining operations in Afro - Colombian consejos comunitarios , indigenous resguardos , and forest reserves established under Law 2/1959 is destabilizing local governance . Over and above the public policy context per se , the politics surrounding the mining sector raises a difficult conundrum for reform . While most sector stakeholders – from public entities to private mining companies and smaller miners – acknowledge that broad - scale reform of the sector would be advisable , the politics of the mining sector favor maintaining the status quo . This is typified by sustained negative public opinion of the sector by well - organized and vocal civil society groups and rejection of mining in high profile local consultation processes , which has led to a ruling by the Constitutional Court to put such processes in legal limbo ( Corte Constitucional , 2018 ) . Social dynamics . Interactions among and small-scale gold mining operations , regional and national authorities , and larger companies are often conflictive . Numerous stakeholders coexist in an intricate network of formal and informal arrangements , regulations , and traditions . Informal miners ’ lack of secure property rights is a traditional obstacle to formalization . Without clear routes to titling , miners are more likely to sell their gold at a significant discount ( up to 30 percent below official gold price ) on the black market , which is frequently linked to money laundering and leaves miners vulnerable to extortion . Concentrations of male migrant workers in mining areas have resulted in increased prostitution , youth pregnancy , violence against women , and child labor . Although and small-scale gold mining operators can sometimes be highly organized locally ( e.g. , the Asociación de Agromineros del Cauca alone has 1,300 members ) and the volume of cash in local gold economies is significant , operations can not access new technology , credit , or legal assistance to institute safer practices and eliminate child labor , mitigate environmental impacts , and secure themselves against illegal groups that threaten to destabilize the country ’s peace - building goals . Although there has been positive movement and willingness by larger mining companies to embrace mining formalization and develop and small-scale gold mining “ co- existence ” models within their titles , relatively few active private industrial mining companies have been willing to take the leap of entering into binding legalization / formalization agreements with small - scale miners on a large scale . Environmental challenges . Four main impacts are associated with informal and illegal and small-scale gold mining in Colombia : ( i ) severe alteration of landscapes , including significant deforestation and associated losses of biodiversity and soil structure ; ( ii ) disruptions to hydrological functions and fragile benthic biology from uncontrolled discharge of sediment into natural drainages and wetlands and alterations of riverbeds and riparian vegetation ; ( iii ) contamination of soil , air , water , and aquatic food chains by 4 discharge of toxic mercury used in the amalgamation process to extract fine gold particles ; and ( iv ) acute and chronic effect to human health from exposure to multiple sources of mercury in contaminated environments . In 2019 , it was estimated that 92,000 ha of land and forests have been significantly altered or wholly degraded by mechanized alluvial and small-scale gold mining in Colombia , with trends accelerating ( United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime , 2018 ) . Impacts from unregulated mining can have repercussions for ecosystems and populations located downstream of mining sites . The impacts from mercury use in and small-scale gold mining are especially nefarious . Colombia ranks among the top five countries in overall mercury consumption ( United Nations Environmental Programme , 2015 ) and is the world ’s largest mercury polluter per capita from and small-scale gold mining ( Cordy et al . , 2011 ) . It is estimated that in 2012 , gold mining by small operators in Colombia released over 200 tons of mercury into the environment ( Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales , 2014 ) . Although there is no official figure for gaseous emissions of mercury , monitoring airborne mercury that was done over three years in eight municipalities in Antioquia , where most gold buying shops are located , showed concentrations in excess of permissible levels as defined by the World Health Organization ( United States Agency for International Development , 2020 ) . Metallic mercury is converted into mobile forms that are inhaled and accumulate along the food chain , concentrating in human tissues and causing a range of health problems from genetic malformations to cancers ( Wotruba et.al , 1998 ) . Children and pregnant women are especially at risk . A study of the mercury value chain shows that imports into Colombia decreased from 150 tons per year in 2009 to 104 tons in 2013 ( Ministry of Mines and Energy , 2014 ) ; however , these figures are based on legal imports and exclude all contraband mercury , which is believed to be significant . In the same report , the government identifies 29 “ mercury hot spots ” located in seven departments ( including Antioquia and Chocó ) that represent 95 percent of national gold production and concludes that mercury use has remained largely stable . Somewhat more positively , field monitoring of airborne mercury and mercury use at mine sites where the United States Agency for International Development ( United States Agency for International Development ) Legal Gold or “ Oro Legal ” Activity supports and small-scale gold mining operators has shown significant reductions in mercury use , particularly by smaller , alluvial operators with the introduction of new practices . A three - fold increase in the price of mercury in areas where and small-scale gold mining is traditionally undertaken , arising from a significant reduction in legal imports of mercury instituted by the Colombian Ministry of Commerce , is another major factor for the decrease in mercury use by these mining production units ( United States Agency for International Development , 2019 ) . 2 . Why formalization of the and small-scale gold mining sector is so critical Mining formalization that clearly defines resource rights , rules , and responsibilities is fundamental to the improvement of the social , environmental , and economic performance of the and small-scale gold mining subsector and can contribute to broader government goals to consolidate the peace process , transform economies overshadowed by illicit transactions , and make local groups and communities more resilient and self- reliant . As the interest of the Colombian government is to progress towards full legality in the sector with a short - term goal of 60 percent of total gold production derived from titled mining production units by 2022 5 ( government of Colombia , 2018 ) , a logical starting point is a clear division between those miners who want to formalize and those who are linked to criminal groups or carry out mining in areas where it is impossible to operate legally , establishing a balance between state control and market incentives . For the former group , the institutional and policy context for and small-scale gold mining in Colombia is characterized by a complex regulatory framework and onerous bureaucracy with competing agendas and varied perspectives across different sectors and levels of government . For small - scale miners interested in formalizing their activity , overcoming regulatory obstacles is exceedingly costly and fraught with long approval delays that can extend for years or even decades , thus posing significant barriers to entry and disincentives for miners to begin the process . Small - scale miners are clear about these obstacles , as expressed in the words of one miner who took five years to complete the formalization process : \" If it is almost impossible for good miners to formalize in this country , how are we going to stop the bad ones and modernize the sector ? \" This is a shrewd and profound observation that should attract the attention of authorities and merits a coherent response . Formalization of the and small-scale gold mining sector is not only a response to improve the circumstances of many rural areas afflicted by insecurity , instability , and illegality , but is also the first critical step in modernizing the sector and generating significant positive multiplier effects to achieve other goals set by the government´s National Development Plan ( government of Colombia , 2018 ) . By way of example , the use , approval , and oversight of rigorous but simpler and less costly Mine Operating Plans ( PTOs ) and Environmental Impact Studies ( Environmental Impact Studies ) – the two basic instruments required for formalization of mining production units ( referred to here by their Spanish acronyms ) – would raise the social , economic , and environmental performance of operators and contribute to higher - level security outcomes and combatting organized crime . Easier accessibility to formalization processes by and small-scale gold mining operators would trigger an increasing flow of social , economic , and environmental improvements . These include the following : Social development Raising the legitimacy of and small-scale gold mining operators and the gold mining sector , thus reducing the repercussions from the stigma that and small-scale gold mining carries vis - à - vis Colombian society and internationally , which can not be understated . Lower levels of fear and insecurity that permeate the lives of many and small-scale gold mining families and communities . Eligibility for social benefits , such as accident and disability insurance and enrollment in pension plans . Improved public health with wider access to health services , reduced exposure to mercury , and worker safety measures . Eradication of child labor and higher levels of school enrollment . 6 Broader , more equitable participation and empowerment of women , youth , and ethnic minorities . Rising levels of self - determination and well - being as the corrosive impact on families and communities , as well as fear that is engendered by involvement in illegal or even criminal operations , subsides . Economic development Securing licit economic growth that displaces criminality . Formal , more stable and better paying jobs , which reduces inequality and resentment . Improved incomes as a fuller percentage of gold prices is captured by small operators who extract themselves from the illicit markets and enter restructured , legal markets . Higher levels of productivity with access to new technologies , innovative practices , training programs , technical assistance , and finance as and small-scale gold mining operators become eligible to enter government vocational and incentive programs like international responsible gold initiatives . Increased revenues to governments from compliance with tax and royalty payments . Possibility for miners to enter international premium markets and thus improve the image of the Colombian mining sector . Possibility to opt out of unsustainable or marginal and small-scale gold mining by transitioning into alternative licit income - generating activities introduced into rural economies . Environmental management Reduced impact to water , soil , forest resources , and biodiversity with formal mine operating and environmental mitigation plans . Prevention of mercury emissions and accumulation in ecosystems and aquatic food chains affecting wildlife and human health . Mitigation of climate change from land use change and deforestation . Post - mining restoration / reclamation to stabilize mined areas and repair / recover damage to ecological functions and/or socio - economic value . 3 . International cooperation : United States Agency for International Development ( United States Agency for International Development ) and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs ( Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development ) In support of government of Colombia efforts to promote responsible mining , the governments of the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through their respective cooperation programs . United States Agency for International Development ’s “ Oro Legal ” Activity responds to the growing social conflict , environmental impact , and governance challenges arising from the recent gold mining boom in Colombia . The Activity recognizes that uncontrolled and small-scale gold mining is a stimulus for both illegality and wide - scale environmental degradation , while at the same time leaving large groups of operators vulnerable to extortion by illegal armed groups , which threatens Colombia`s peace - building efforts . In implementing its activities , Oro Legal acts as a 7 “ neutral stakeholder , ” neither expanding nor reducing mining activity per se , but rather , supporting responsible mining where is it is technically , financially , and legally feasible to do so in close concert with Colombian government entities . Oro Legal is geographically focused in the regions of Antioquia and Chocó and has two main objectives . The first is to build effective governance capacity for legal and formal and small-scale gold mining activities by working with the government of Colombia to make formalization more accessible by supporting participation of ASGMs in formalization programs with training and technical assistance . Currently , Oro Legal is consolidating a portfolio of 11 mining formalization projects comprising 135 mining production units , with 47 mining production units formalized to date . Almost three tons of legal gold produced by Oro Legal - supported mining production units , generating approximately US$ 125 million in licit revenue ; more than US$ 9 million in royalties , taxes , and social security payments ; and eliminating 45 tons of mercury from the gold production process . The business , technical , and environmental performance of Oro Legal - supported mining production units that have entered the formalization process is steadily improving as measured against baselines , underpinned by technical assistance at mine sites . Several formalized mining production units are on a pathway to enter more rigorous international standards - based programs that offer additional price and financial incentives . The second objective is to reduce the environmental impact caused by illegal mining through restoration of degraded areas and developing alternative livelihoods for mining families that can not or should not be involved in gold mining . Since 2015 , Oro Legal has supported rehabilitation of areas degraded by past illegal mining on almost 17,000 ha in both Antioquia and Chocó . This has been done in collaboration with landowners , Afro - Colombian communities , and municipalities and regional governments , and has been a locally important job - creation engine . In conjunction with tree planting in degraded areas in Antioquia , more than 300 people , many of them women and former subsistence miners , manage 11 honey production projects . As all these hives come into full production , honey production is projected to rise to approximately 400 tons by mid-2020 , equal to 12 percent of total national production . In Chocó , 300 families have planted 670 ha of annatto trees that produce seeds from which a natural colorant ( bixin ) is extracted . Commercial alliances between a new community commercial entity and private companies will position this production for sale in national and international markets . Arising from a wish to improve the situation of and small-scale gold mining miners , the Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small - Scale Mining ( Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners ) was set up in 2013 as a private - public partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association ( Swiss Better Gold Association ) and the Swiss Economic Cooperation and Development . The initiative relies on the importance of the Swiss market , brings together leading players in the gold sector , and creates sustainable and transparent conditions along the gold value chain . It supports the implementation of a number of international initiatives like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict - Affected and High - Risk Areas , which guides companies to ensure that their mineral sourcing does not finance 8 conflicts ( Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , 2016 ) . In addition , Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners supports the implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury , which aims to minimize mercury emissions . Peru was the first country to implement the Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners , beginning in 2013 . Currently , 3,000 kg of responsibly produced gold from ASGMs are exported from Peru to Switzerland . The initiative offers a market - based premium of US$ 1,000 / kg for responsibly produced and small-scale gold mining gold . The increasing interest of the and small-scale gold mining sector and public institutions in Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners ’s approach and the increasing demand for Better Gold by Swiss industry were crucial to expansion of the Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners program from Peru to Bolivia and Colombia since 2017 . In Colombia , Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners is working with more than 20 small - scale mining operations , mainly in Antioquia , towards compliance with Better Gold criteria . In 2020 , the goal is to export 400 kg of responsible gold , mainly from Antioquia and small-scale gold mining operators , to markets in Switzerland . In addition , Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners is supporting the subsistence mining sector , gold panners or “ barequeros ” in Chocó Department . Since 2019 , approximately 10 kg of gold / month have been exported to Switzerland by roughly 500 mainly female panners who conform to Better Gold criteria . In Colombia , Oro Legal and SGBA - Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners have formed a working alliance whereby mining production units that are formalized and demonstrate sufficient improvement with support from Oro Legal can “ graduate ” into the Swiss Better Gold Association Better Gold “ escalator ” and access legal value chains and Swiss markets with a minimum of intermediation ( see Figure 1 ) . 4 . Pathways to formalization The starting point for improving performance of the and small-scale gold mining sector and achieving higher level social , economic , environmental , and security goals is formalization at scale . This is a two - step process : ( i ) mining production units must have legal title or access to mining areas , and ( ii ) MPU operations must be fully compliant with applicable laws , regulations , and technical norms . Accomplishing these two steps is juridically , technically , and economically daunting even for more advanced , industrial - scale gold mining production units . During the design and initial work planning phases of Oro Legal in 2015 , six viable routes were identified for legalization and formalization of and small-scale gold mining operators ( see Figure 2 ) . As most mining areas are already titled and some 63 percent of and small-scale gold mining operations do not hold titles , the three most viable , but still complex , routes identified at that time were operating contracts , formalization subcontracts , and devolution of mining areas for subsequent titling by ASGMs . During a pilot program funded by United States Agency for International Development that was a precursor to Oro Legal , support was provided to the then - Ministry of Mines and Energy to draft a resolution to regulate the third pathway , “ Devolution of Claims for Formalization , ” but the instrument was never adopted . Ironically , the “ Special Reserve Area ” pathway was deemed at that time to have limited possibilities ; however , there has been a modest expansion of “ Special Reserve Areas ” by the National Mining Agency ( ANM ) , although regulations like the total prohibition on the use of mechanized equipment stymy productivity and investment in improving performance . 9 As Figure 2 illustrates , historic and current legislation that underpins pathways to formalization is complex and is supported by an array of often competing laws , decrees , and regulations developed over a long period , responding to the interests of a variety of groups as well as political expediency that ebbs and flows over time . The conundrum , of course , is that while most mining experts and sector stakeholders agree that a new Mining Law would be the best way forward , no one holds any great optimism that it could indeed be negotiated and so , in practice most of them adopt a “ better the devil you know ” approach , attempting to make the best use of available pathways to move forward , however slow and costly this process often is . In light of evolving government of Colombia mining policy , there has been a shrinking of the “ de facto ” routes to formalization , which for all intents and purposes are limited to only three : ( i ) subsistence miners who are able to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year ( Ministry of Mines and Energy , 2017 ) ; ( ii ) miners who reach civil legal agreements with private titleholders to legally mine on these titles , largely via formalization subcontracts ; and ( iii ) miners who can comply with the criteria to apply for a Special Mining Reserve Area and operate in these areas with approval of the ANM . For most other and small-scale gold mining operators , the only other effective alternative is to apply for and develop on open , untitled areas a traditional mining title , moving from exploration through to exploitation and ultimately , mine closure . However , in areas such as Antioquia , where 95 percent of the department is either already titled or has permissions for titles “ in place , ” the probability of finding untitled areas that are commercially viable is very low . Within this context , the demands of compliance with exacting government of Colombia mining and environmental legislation will continue to represent the biggest challenge to more expansive and small-scale gold mining mining formalization , even via a truncated group of pathways . Again , there is consensus among industry players that mining at all levels generates impacts that should be planned for and adequately managed and mitigated , but the focus on costly and complicated ex - ante mining plans and environmental licenses effectively constitutes an insurmountable barrier for many and small-scale gold mining operators who want to become formalized . By way of example , and as part of the Activity ’s mandate to support and small-scale gold mining formalization , Oro Legal has had to field a team of 17 technical specialists ( including biologists , water engineers , archeologists , and others ) to comply with demanding terms of reference for the preparation of Environmental Impact Studies by regional environmental authorities at a cost of roughly US$ 50,000 per EIA developed . Further , most Environmental Impact Studies take between one to three years to review , frequently generating hundreds of technical observations , which must be fully addressed before approval is granted . Unsurprisingly , given these hurdles , perverse incentives quickly emerge and an institutional desire for exhaustive environmental control ironically results in no environmental control at all . 5 . Obstacles to formalization : stakeholder consultations In an effort to move and small-scale gold mining formalization to the top of the agenda of the then - new administration of President Iván Duque , Oro Legal and Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners , with support from the United States and Swiss 10 governments , initiated a process to develop practical proposals for the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 , which was then in preparation . This was done through a multi - stakeholder engagement process to identify entry points within the existing legal and institutional framework for concrete improvements to increase formalization of and small-scale gold mining operators . A series of focus groups was conducted between April and May 2018 , including 13 consultations with small - scale gold miners and other sector stakeholders involved in the formalization process in five departments ( Antioquia , Chocó , Sur de Bolivar , Santander , and Cauca ) , and five others with representatives from academia , non- governmental organizations ( non- governmental organizations ) , large private mining companies , and government authorities linked to the sector . Interviews and meetings were also conducted with key informants in the Ministry of Mines and Energy ; Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development ; departmental governments , particularly the Mining Secretariat of Antioquia ; regional environmental authorities ; and local governments , particularly municipalities in Bajo Cauca , Antioquia that shed light on the effect of the competing agendas and perspectives mentioned above , as well as high staff turnover , varying institutional capacity , and political constraints to improving the regulatory framework for formalization ( Jaime Arteaga & Asociados , 2018 ) . During the consultation process , a consensus emerged across stakeholder groups around a number of principal obstacles to and small-scale gold mining entry into formalization processes , which , taken as a whole , create immense disincentives for these operators to make the investment to do so . These key issues are presented below : Key Issue 1 . Disarticulation between policies and legal frameworks and and small-scale gold mining realities and needs . National mining policies , laws , regulations , and norms across several ministries , agencies , and levels of government create a legal framework that is ill - adapted for and small-scale gold mining . Disarticulation is particularly acute between the Ministry of Mines and Energy , ANM , Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development , and , in the case of Antioquia , the departmental Mining Secretariat . For example , the same comprehensive requirements for Environmental Impact Studies are applied uniformly to all to mining production units regardless of scale , sophistication , equipment used , processing technology , geographic location , ecological factors , or potential environmental footprint . A plethora of competing and incompatible institutional interests and mandates has stymied collaborative processes with miners on rule - setting and enforcement , consideration of and small-scale gold mining in the context of all actors along the supply chain , experience - sharing , and awareness - raising . This situation is exacerbated by many officials ’ limited knowledge of on - the - ground realities and scant field experience , which leads to distinct interpretations of mining , environmental , labor , and other regulations as well as extremely slow approval processes . For example , it has taken the mines that make up the recently approved Special Concessions Contract in Tarazá , Antioquia – which has recently entered the Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners program – 18 years to work through the governmental approval maze to become formalized . There is a reluctance on the part of authorities to recognize the hard fact that government alone can not manage or control many thousands of and small-scale gold mining operators . National and regional mining and environmental authorities are largely absent in the mining areas , further isolating decision - makers from realities in the field and leaving miners and local mayors to go it mostly alone . This rigidity and 11 lack of field presence has stifled alliance - building and exploration of co - management arrangements among all actors – large and small mining production units , upstream and downstream operators – as approaches to improve the regulatory framework , aid the government of Colombia to attain fuller compliance , and foster higher performance in the sector . Key Issue 2 . Conditions that favor informality . As in many countries , once legality can be determined , the formalization process in Colombia is wrought with onerous , excessively costly requirements , and lengthy review and approval processes . As noted previously , environmental and technical requirements to operate legally are undifferentiated as to type , size , and location of the MPU . As one and small-scale gold mining participant put it , “ It is not at all the same to do mining in Chocó as in La Guajira and a simple mini - dredge with a small pump operated by two people ca n’t be compared to operations that use heavy mechanized equipment . ” The two main instruments for formalization – PTOs and Environmental Impact Studies – are out of reach for most and small-scale gold mining operators given their limited organizational and financial capacity to contract and pay for highly specialized technical services to prepare these instruments and subsequently comply with all approved mitigation , monitoring , and operational measures . The cost of preparing the PTO together with the EIA can exceed US$ 50,000 , even for mining production units with a footprint of less than 100 square meters . Except in Special Reserve Areas , regulations prohibit grouping more than one MPU under the same PTO or EIA . As one participant lamented , “ It is incomprehensible how the same requirements apply to such vastly different operations . The obligations placed on us small miners scare me . ” Further , rigid requirements and an “ all - or - nothing ” approach for approval of PTOs and Environmental Impact Studies runs counter to the intentions of the government ’s 2013 National Formalization Policy that recognized formalization as a process rather than one - off regulatory compliance ( Echavarria , C. , 2014 ) . and small-scale gold mining supply chains in Colombia are especially vulnerable to capture by criminal consortia . Remnant FARC elements and the ELN , a lesser known revolutionary left - wing armed group , are still active in many remote mining areas like Chocó , and extort informal / illegal and small-scale gold mining to finance their operations ( DuPée . M. C. , 2018 ) . Barriers to legitimate markets and buyers are put up by criminal groups and vested interests that dominate commercial transactions . This is compounded by how , in comparison to other rural sectors , informal and small-scale gold mining operators have little legitimacy to access legal financial services for formalization and to invest in improved practices . Traditions of and small-scale gold mining communities are little valued by government and the social and historical roots of traditional miners are little accounted for in granting of mining titles and formalization processes , compared to large companies and individuals with more means . Key Issue 3 . Difficulty reconciling and small-scale gold mining needs and mining titleholder rights . Some larger private sector operators have the perception that it is extremely difficult to engage , negotiate , and reach agreement with and small-scale gold mining operators on their title and do n’t fully appreciate the benefits of making the investment to do so . This is compounded when companies perceive that and small-scale gold mining formalization is not a priority of the government , judging from its lack of engagement in the process . This is changing as 12 security concerns and illicit economies tied to illegal mining persist and local and small-scale gold mining operators increasingly organize to express their needs . Also , programs like Oro Legal and Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners are helpful in their role as honest brokers between parties to guide discussions and legitimize agreements . Key Issue 4 . Limited development options for subsistence miners . The government of Colombia recognizes the legitimacy of subsistence mining , typically defined as unmechanized mining that brings together individual gold panners and other rudimentary miners who are allowed to produce and legally sell up to 420 grams of gold per year . Leaving aside the challenge of illicit stakeholders co - opting these miners to launder illegal gold ( there have been several “ sting ” operations by authorities that have unearthed hundreds of taxi drivers , housewives , bakery workers , etc . , all registered as subsistence miners by unscrupulous commercialization outfits , all “ selling ” their legally permitted limit of 420 grams / year with most having no knowledge that these sales had taken place ) , there is also a broader development challenge for these miners . In areas such as Istmina in Chocó , where much of the territory remains off - limits to larger - scale mining and dynamic river systems and isolated flood plains offer good conditions for gold panning , the challenge is to help geographically isolated and poorly educated miners avoid exploitation by the plethora of local intermediaries who buy gold for cash at highly discounted prices . Against this backdrop , Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners has recently launched an innovative project with gold panners in Istmina , Chocó , which has brought 500 subsistence gold panners into an international supply chain . The linchpin of this initiative is application of an internationally recognized due diligence system implemented by an international gold trader based in Colombia . This is done via biometrics , documents , and live video feeds to monitor and control each commercial transaction that can then pass through formal banking channels and allows for full segregation of the gold from the rest of the supply chain . The chain of custody is tightly controlled by reducing the level of intermediation with the Colombia - based international gold trader exporting the segregated gold directly to a Swiss refiner and who then sells on the responsibly produced gold to a renowned Swiss jewelry brand that is a member of Swiss Better Gold Association . The mostly female subsistence “ barequeros ” benefit from this international supply chain by capturing a large percentage of the gold price and an additional Swiss Better Gold Association - BGI premium payment . Additionally , this project aims to eradicate child labor in the Chocó region through engagement with a local NGO . In other areas , such as the Bajo Cauca region of Antioquia , extensive alluvial gold mining has significantly reduced the profitability of gold panning , a main livelihood for large numbers of single , female heads of household . These “ barequeras ” report paltry returns from panning since more accessible , productive areas are usually mined successively by illegal operators using heavy machinery and powerful washing plants . For these subsistence miners , the logical solution is to move out of this highly precarious rung on the and small-scale gold mining value chain and into an alternative economic activity that offers a decent wage . Oro Legal has worked for several years with this group of miners to address the challenges they face through support to then - nascent honey production in Bajo Cauca for 13 community owned and managed apiaries . The installation of some 11,500 beehives over 11 apiculture projects has allowed more than 300 ex - mining families to earn , on average , 1.5 times the Colombian minimum monthly wage ( approximately US$ 280 / month ) for a few days of work each week . In the second half of 2019 , these apiaries produced about 90 tons of honey , generating US$ 250,000 in income for these families . This volume is expected to exceed 400 tons by mid-2020 . While these returns are unlikely to turn the heads of larger miners , for the thousands for subsistence miners who operate at the lower echelons of the and small-scale gold mining “ value chain , ” such alternative livelihoods offer a stable , dignified , and legal economic option to subsistence gold mining . 6 . A proposal to expand and small-scale gold mining formalization : National Unified Formalization Plan ( National Unified Formalization Plan ) The inputs and conclusions of the stakeholder consultation process were analyzed by national and international experts from the two cooperation programs and a consensus emerged for practical proposals to reduce transaction costs of formalization ( titling , PTOs , Environmental Impact Studies , monitoring , reporting ) and to accompany small - scale miners along this process . The recommendations were presented to the Colombian government jointly by the United States and the Swiss Confederation through their respective embassies . The recommendations are purposely modest in scope with a focus on practical steps that can be implemented by Colombian authorities without entering into a wholesale policy reviews and reforms or promulgation of new laws . The main recommendation is the creation of a National Unified Formalization Plan ( National Unified Formalization Plan ) whose objective is to enable small - scale miners to transition to formality by more closely coordinating functions and procedures of the main government actors involved . This approach is consistent with the National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 to lower regulatory requirements and raise productivity of the private sector and that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , of which Colombia became the 37th member in 2018 . The proposal for a National Unified Formalization Plan is built on six pillars : 1 . Differentiated approach . In recognition of the conditions , challenges , and opportunities faced by and small-scale gold mining operators and their relationship with large companies , separate categories should be defined for and small-scale gold mining and the concept of “ traditional mining ” reassessed . This would be the starting point for distinguishing between criminal mining operations and miners who want and are eligible to enter a formalization process with differentiated regulatory instruments and procedures tailored to the conditions of small operators . This approach has a dual purpose in allowing the government to transition a greater number of mines into the formal economy , while better targeting its law enforcement efforts on mining operations that are wholly criminal . 2 . Simplification of procedures and processes . A single , one - stop shop or window for formalization of small - scale mining operators would be created based on : ( i ) aligning the requirements and review of mine operational and environmental instruments to the scale of production and on - the - ground footprint ; ( ii ) reasonable and firm guidelines and response times for authorities to review and approve environmental and operational instruments ; ( iii ) decentralization of several key 14 functions of the ANM to the department level ; and ( iv ) issuance of required Mineral Commercialization Permits according to the selected formalization pathway , be it through designation of mining areas for specific recipients ( Special Mining Reserve Areas , new titles ) , application for a mining concession contract , or under an operations contract for and small-scale gold mining located in areas already titled to large companies . 3 . Effective articulation between institutions at national and local levels . The National Unified Formalization Plan would define a coordination strategy and procedures between the Ministry of Mines and Energy , Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development , ANM , law enforcement agencies , and Regional Autonomous Corporations ( departmental environmental authorities ) with the objective of empowering local actors and decentralizing regulatory authority , especially in those regions with important and small-scale gold mining sectors . More effective coordination would also contribute to solidifying the legitimacy of the State in these regions , many of which are located in post - conflict areas . 4 . Accompaniment in the formalization process . As pillars 1 – 3 are adopted , small - scale miners who enter the formalization process will need support across several fronts . Technical assistance and training will be required to mitigate environmental impacts and increase productivity and serve as an incentive . This would be delivered through a network of accredited technical advisors with experience in formalization processes and creation of “ and small-scale gold mining service centers ” through public - private partnerships . Access to banking and financial services needs to be opened to small - scale miners and a point - of - sale for gold established that offers transparent transactions based on international prices and on internally accepted due diligence processes as an alternative to illegal markets and buyers . Finally , the financial incentives to transition small - scale miners to zero - mercury and cleaner technologies provided for under the current Mercury Law and in compliance with Colombia ’s obligations as a signatory to the Minamata Convention should be made operational . 5 . Livelihood alternatives to subsistence . Given how many artisanal and small - scale gold miners struggle to eke out a living at the subsistence level , frequently operating in inhospitable and precarious working conditions , the National Unified Formalization Plan would act as an articulating mechanism with other relevant stakeholders ( e.g. , the Ministry of Agriculture , departmental governments , municipalities ) to develop alternative livelihood options for vulnerable miners who are looking for an exit ramp out of the sector . Since such options would contribute to reducing illegality and negative externalities in the mining sector , it would be logical and justified to allocate funding through transfers from centrally managed mining royalties and directly engage the private mining sector actors . It is interesting that Mineros SA , a gold mining company that operates in the municipality of El Bagre , Antioquia , already has a successful program to produce honey as well as natural latex from rubber plantations on formally mined land , which can serve as a model for a broader alternative livelihood initiative with support from other mining companies . 6 . Permanent dialogue . Open , continuous dialogue is critical to the success of the National Unified Formalization Plan . The stakeholder dialogue spaces supported by Oro Legal and Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining for and Small Miners that led to the proposal for a National Unified Formalization Plan should be made permanent and be expanded to the national level and to those departments 15 where and small-scale gold mining is most prevalent . There is a precedent for such fora in the Mining Roundtable for Chocó , which is principally a government initiative . If meaningful alliance - building is to take root to create conditions that favor formality and overall performance change in the and small-scale gold mining sector , all concerned parties will need to have an equal voice . Such a modality will be the first step towards a co- management framework whereby informal and small-scale gold mining is delinked from criminality and the Colombian government can count on an increasing number of formalized and small-scale gold mining allies to strengthen governance and compliance in the sector . Acknowledgments The authors wish to recognize the invaluable collaboration of government of Colombia counterparts and and small-scale gold mining , private sector , and other partners in our joint efforts to improve the performance of and small-scale gold mining in Colombia and its contribution to national development . To this end , the wealth of knowledge and experience and progress achieved by the Oro Legal Activity and Better Gold Initiative would not have been possible without the support of the United States Agency for International Development and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs , respectively . Finally , we would like to express our gratitude to our field teams for the dedication , creativity , and resourcefulness they consistently demonstrate in carrying out their work .

Context problem statement Recent administrations Colombia highlighted importance legality , pointing mining sector particular area interest national development . In Colombia , gold mining principle extractive industries . Artisanal small - scale gold mining ( ASGM ) important economic activity rural areas long tradition Colombian history culture . ASGM increasingly prevalent informal economic activity , typical countries weak institutional capacity adequately control regulate sector ( Hilson , 2009 ) . In Colombia , compounded long period internal conflict State absent areas , especially rural , isolated ones ASGM typically concentrated . In Colombian context , small - scale mining operations2 correspond 94 percent gold mining operations nationwide , 60 percent untitled operations considered illegal , cases , finance organized crime ( UNODC , 2018 ) . Substantial incomes gold mining ease operating informally attracted 500,000 Colombians activity type mining relatively accessible livelihood option available vulnerable populations ( Hentschel et . , 2002 ) . According Mining Census , conducted 2011/2012,3 14,357 mining production units ( MPUs ) recorded , 4,133 MPUs produce gold account 90 percent MPUs produce precious minerals Colombia ( MME , 2012 ) . Despite magnitude activity , 13.3 percent MPUs legally titled , 87 percent 3,584 gold MPUs classified informal illegal .

This paper draws study formalization artisanal small gold mining commissioned USAID Oro Legal Activity SECO Better Gold Initiative , recommendations presented government Colombia . 2 Under Decree 1666 2016 , Ministry Mines Energy defines small - scale gold mining operations occupying 150 exploration pre - production phase extract 15,000 tons ore annually underground mines 250,000 m3 / year ore alluvial mining . 3 The Mining Census includes extractive activities precious non - precious minerals construction materials . 2 legal gold markets Colombia . By estimate , gold mining generated approximately US$ 2.4 billion revenues , times generated trafficking cocaine produced Colombia , exports registered US$ 1.78 billion ( ANM , 2018 ) . Like cocaine , illegal mining poses litany security , governance , social , environmental challenges ( DuPée , M. C. , 2018 ) . Security challenges . As providing livelihood marginal rural families , informal illegal gold mining finances illegal groups . The list violent competitors vying gold riches window Colombia social fault lines conflicts : National Liberation Army , ELN , leftist guerilla group comprises approximately 2,000 combatants ; El Clan Golfo , criminal syndicate ; 1990s - paramilitary group known United Self Defense Forces Colombia AUC ; members defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia FARC . As response , Colombian government ramped enforcement task forces campaigns disrupted numerous operations . In 2017 , Task Force Titan eliminated massive illegal mining operation Chocó organized Clan Golfo , destroying $ 4.2 million heavy machinery contraband ( DuPée , M. C. , 2018 ) . Despite high - profile victories illegal actors , interdiction efforts impact small fraction overall production sector , demonstrating approach improve current policy involve “ carrot ” “ stick . ” At specific juncture , backdrop consolidating historic peace agreement FARC , time , addressing security threats organized crime groups , challenge facing GOC stakeholders gold mining sector exploit undoubted potential gold mining offers legal , responsible way , working strengthen governance rule law . Governance . Governance capacity gold mining sector highly centralized . Of Colombia 32 regional governments , Antioquia enjoys delegated authority sector role municipalities restricted local enforcement . The Ministry Mines Energy ( MME ) solid legislative platform underpin change , specific opportunities better regulation remain . For example , incentives Article 10 Mercury Law 1658/2013 regulation Article 248 Law 685/2001 expand pathways legalization / formalization materialized . National entities generally - resourced , regional local capacity varies – example , Antioquia department functioning mining secretariat , regional entities Chocó department . There strong demand departments municipalities decentralization authorities decision - making ( Echavarria , C. , 2014 ) . Governance understood broadest context , extending government ASGM operations mining associations . Although MME Ministry Environment Sustainable Development ( MADS ) large set legislative regulatory tools , translated better control , management , - - ground performance MPUs . For instance , credit facilities created legal miners eliminate mercury use , above- mentioned Article 10 Mercury Law 1658/2013 . Despite generally strong commitment national 3 authorities apply legal norms , scale gold boom dwarfed capacity respond . Technical expertise , budget resources , political capital concentrated national entities regional local capacity , resources , political vary widely . Municipalities reluctant undertake enforcement actions lose jobs votes . Although ASGM associations exist , capable offering services members limited political clout . In Chocó , growing presence illegal mining operations Afro - Colombian consejos comunitarios , indigenous resguardos , forest reserves established Law 2/1959 destabilizing local governance . Over public policy context , politics surrounding mining sector raises difficult conundrum reform . While sector stakeholders – public entities private mining companies smaller miners – acknowledge broad - scale reform sector advisable , politics mining sector favor maintaining status quo . This typified sustained negative public opinion sector - organized vocal civil society groups rejection mining high profile local consultation processes , led ruling Constitutional Court processes legal limbo ( Corte Constitucional , 2018 ) . Social dynamics . Interactions ASGM operations , regional national authorities , larger companies conflictive . Numerous stakeholders coexist intricate network formal informal arrangements , regulations , traditions . Informal miners ’ lack secure property rights traditional obstacle formalization . Without clear routes titling , miners likely sell gold significant discount ( 30 percent official gold price ) black market , frequently linked money laundering leaves miners vulnerable extortion . Concentrations male migrant workers mining areas resulted increased prostitution , youth pregnancy , violence women , child labor . Although ASGM operators highly organized locally ( e.g. , Asociación Agromineros Cauca 1,300 members ) volume cash local gold economies significant , operations access new technology , credit , legal assistance institute safer practices eliminate child labor , mitigate environmental impacts , secure illegal groups threaten destabilize country peace - building goals . Although positive movement willingness larger mining companies embrace mining formalization develop ASGM “ co- existence ” models titles , relatively active private industrial mining companies willing leap entering binding legalization / formalization agreements small - scale miners large scale . Environmental challenges . Four main impacts associated informal illegal ASGM Colombia : ( ) severe alteration landscapes , including significant deforestation associated losses biodiversity soil structure ; ( ii ) disruptions hydrological functions fragile benthic biology uncontrolled discharge sediment natural drainages wetlands alterations riverbeds riparian vegetation ; ( iii ) contamination soil , air , water , aquatic food chains 4 discharge toxic mercury amalgamation process extract fine gold particles ; ( iv ) acute chronic effect human health exposure multiple sources mercury contaminated environments . In 2019 , estimated 92,000 land forests significantly altered wholly degraded mechanized alluvial ASGM Colombia , trends accelerating ( UNODC , 2018 ) . Impacts unregulated mining repercussions ecosystems populations located downstream mining sites . The impacts mercury use ASGM especially nefarious . Colombia ranks countries overall mercury consumption ( UNEP , 2015 ) world largest mercury polluter capita ASGM ( Cordy et . , 2011 ) . It estimated 2012 , gold mining small operators Colombia released 200 tons mercury environment ( IDEAM , 2014 ) . Although official figure gaseous emissions mercury , monitoring airborne mercury years municipalities Antioquia , gold buying shops located , showed concentrations excess permissible levels defined World Health Organization ( USAID , 2020 ) . Metallic mercury converted mobile forms inhaled accumulate food chain , concentrating human tissues causing range health problems genetic malformations cancers ( Wotruba et.al , 1998 ) . Children pregnant women especially risk . A study mercury value chain shows imports Colombia decreased 150 tons year 2009 104 tons 2013 ( MME , 2014 ) ; , figures based legal imports exclude contraband mercury , believed significant . In report , government identifies 29 “ mercury hot spots ” located seven departments ( including Antioquia Chocó ) represent 95 percent national gold production concludes mercury use remained largely stable . Somewhat positively , field monitoring airborne mercury mercury use sites United States Agency International Development ( USAID ) Legal Gold “ Oro Legal ” Activity supports ASGM operators shown significant reductions mercury use , particularly smaller , alluvial operators introduction new practices . A - fold increase price mercury areas ASGM traditionally undertaken , arising significant reduction legal imports mercury instituted Colombian Ministry Commerce , major factor decrease mercury use MPUs ( USAID , 2019 ) . 2 . Why formalization ASGM sector critical Mining formalization clearly defines resource rights , rules , responsibilities fundamental improvement social , environmental , economic performance ASGM subsector contribute broader government goals consolidate peace process , transform economies overshadowed illicit transactions , local groups communities resilient self- reliant . As interest Colombian government progress legality sector short - term goal 60 percent gold production derived titled MPUs 2022 5 ( GOC , 2018 ) , logical starting point clear division miners want formalize linked criminal groups carry mining areas impossible operate legally , establishing balance state control market incentives . For group , institutional policy context ASGM Colombia characterized complex regulatory framework onerous bureaucracy competing agendas varied perspectives different sectors levels government . For small - scale miners interested formalizing activity , overcoming regulatory obstacles exceedingly costly fraught long approval delays extend years decades , posing significant barriers entry disincentives miners begin process . Small - scale miners clear obstacles , expressed words miner took years complete formalization process : \" If impossible good miners formalize country , going stop bad ones modernize sector ? \" This shrewd profound observation attract attention authorities merits coherent response . Formalization ASGM sector response improve circumstances rural areas afflicted insecurity , instability , illegality , critical step modernizing sector generating significant positive multiplier effects achieve goals set government´s National Development Plan ( GOC , 2018 ) . By way example , use , approval , oversight rigorous simpler costly Mine Operating Plans ( PTOs ) Environmental Impact Studies ( EIAs ) – basic instruments required formalization MPUs ( referred Spanish acronyms ) – raise social , economic , environmental performance operators contribute higher - level security outcomes combatting organized crime . Easier accessibility formalization processes ASGM operators trigger increasing flow social , economic , environmental improvements . These include following : Social development Raising legitimacy ASGM operators gold mining sector , reducing repercussions stigma ASGM carries vis - à - vis Colombian society internationally , understated . Lower levels fear insecurity permeate lives ASGM families communities . Eligibility social benefits , accident disability insurance enrollment pension plans . Improved public health wider access health services , reduced exposure mercury , worker safety measures . Eradication child labor higher levels school enrollment . 6 Broader , equitable participation empowerment women , youth , ethnic minorities . Rising levels self - determination - corrosive impact families communities , fear engendered involvement illegal criminal operations , subsides . Economic development Securing licit economic growth displaces criminality . Formal , stable better paying jobs , reduces inequality resentment . Improved incomes fuller percentage gold prices captured small operators extract illicit markets enter restructured , legal markets . Higher levels productivity access new technologies , innovative practices , training programs , technical assistance , finance ASGM operators eligible enter government vocational incentive programs like international responsible gold initiatives . Increased revenues governments compliance tax royalty payments . Possibility miners enter international premium markets improve image Colombian mining sector . Possibility opt unsustainable marginal ASGM transitioning alternative licit income - generating activities introduced rural economies . Environmental management Reduced impact water , soil , forest resources , biodiversity formal operating environmental mitigation plans . Prevention mercury emissions accumulation ecosystems aquatic food chains affecting wildlife human health . Mitigation climate change land use change deforestation . Post - mining restoration / reclamation stabilize mined areas repair / recover damage ecological functions and/or socio - economic value . 3 . International cooperation : United States Agency International Development ( USAID ) Swiss State Secretariat Economic Affairs ( SECO ) In support GOC efforts promote responsible mining , governments United States Switzerland providing assistance respective cooperation programs . USAID “ Oro Legal ” Activity responds growing social conflict , environmental impact , governance challenges arising recent gold mining boom Colombia . The Activity recognizes uncontrolled ASGM stimulus illegality wide - scale environmental degradation , time leaving large groups operators vulnerable extortion illegal armed groups , threatens Colombia`s peace - building efforts . In implementing activities , Oro Legal acts 7 “ neutral stakeholder , ” expanding reducing mining activity , , supporting responsible mining technically , financially , legally feasible close concert Colombian government entities . Oro Legal geographically focused regions Antioquia Chocó main objectives . The build effective governance capacity legal formal ASGM activities working GOC formalization accessible supporting participation ASGMs formalization programs training technical assistance . Currently , Oro Legal consolidating portfolio 11 mining formalization projects comprising 135 MPUs , 47 MPUs formalized date . Almost tons legal gold produced Oro Legal - supported MPUs , generating approximately US$ 125 million licit revenue ; US$ 9 million royalties , taxes , social security payments ; eliminating 45 tons mercury gold production process . The business , technical , environmental performance Oro Legal - supported MPUs entered formalization process steadily improving measured baselines , underpinned technical assistance sites . Several formalized MPUs pathway enter rigorous international standards - based programs offer additional price financial incentives . The second objective reduce environmental impact caused illegal mining restoration degraded areas developing alternative livelihoods mining families involved gold mining . Since 2015 , Oro Legal supported rehabilitation areas degraded past illegal mining 17,000 Antioquia Chocó . This collaboration landowners , Afro - Colombian communities , municipalities regional governments , locally important job - creation engine . In conjunction tree planting degraded areas Antioquia , 300 people , women subsistence miners , manage 11 honey production projects . As hives come production , honey production projected rise approximately 400 tons mid-2020 , equal 12 percent national production . In Chocó , 300 families planted 670 annatto trees produce seeds natural colorant ( bixin ) extracted . Commercial alliances new community commercial entity private companies position production sale national international markets . Arising wish improve situation ASGM miners , Better Gold Initiative Artisanal Small - Scale Mining ( BGI ASM ) set 2013 private - public partnership Swiss Better Gold Association ( SBGA ) SECO . The initiative relies importance Swiss market , brings leading players gold sector , creates sustainable transparent conditions gold value chain . It supports implementation number international initiatives like Organization Economic Cooperation Development ( OECD ) Due Diligence Guidance Responsible Supply Chains Minerals Conflict - Affected High - Risk Areas , guides companies ensure mineral sourcing finance 8 conflicts ( OECD , 2016 ) . In addition , BGI ASM supports implementation Minamata Convention Mercury , aims minimize mercury emissions . Peru country implement BGI ASM , beginning 2013 . Currently , 3,000 kg responsibly produced gold ASGMs exported Peru Switzerland . The initiative offers market - based premium US$ 1,000 / kg responsibly produced ASGM gold . The increasing interest ASGM sector public institutions BGI ASM approach increasing demand Better Gold Swiss industry crucial expansion BGI ASM program Peru Bolivia Colombia 2017 . In Colombia , BGI ASM working 20 small - scale mining operations , mainly Antioquia , compliance Better Gold criteria . In 2020 , goal export 400 kg responsible gold , mainly Antioquia ASGM operators , markets Switzerland . In addition , BGI ASM supporting subsistence mining sector , gold panners “ barequeros ” Chocó Department . Since 2019 , approximately 10 kg gold / month exported Switzerland roughly 500 mainly female panners conform Better Gold criteria . In Colombia , Oro Legal SGBA - BGI ASM formed working alliance MPUs formalized demonstrate sufficient improvement support Oro Legal “ graduate ” SBGA Better Gold “ escalator ” access legal value chains Swiss markets minimum intermediation ( Figure 1 ) . 4 . Pathways formalization The starting point improving performance ASGM sector achieving higher level social , economic , environmental , security goals formalization scale . This - step process : ( ) MPUs legal title access mining areas , ( ii ) MPU operations fully compliant applicable laws , regulations , technical norms . Accomplishing steps juridically , technically , economically daunting advanced , industrial - scale gold MPUs . During design initial work planning phases Oro Legal 2015 , viable routes identified legalization formalization ASGM operators ( Figure 2 ) . As mining areas titled 63 percent ASGM operations hold titles , viable , complex , routes identified time operating contracts , formalization subcontracts , devolution mining areas subsequent titling ASGMs . During pilot program funded USAID precursor Oro Legal , support provided - MME draft resolution regulate pathway , “ Devolution Claims Formalization , ” instrument adopted . Ironically , “ Special Reserve Area ” pathway deemed time limited possibilities ; , modest expansion “ Special Reserve Areas ” National Mining Agency ( ANM ) , regulations like prohibition use mechanized equipment stymy productivity investment improving performance . 9 As Figure 2 illustrates , historic current legislation underpins pathways formalization complex supported array competing laws , decrees , regulations developed long period , responding interests variety groups political expediency ebbs flows time . The conundrum , course , mining experts sector stakeholders agree new Mining Law best way forward , holds great optimism negotiated , practice adopt “ better devil know ” approach , attempting best use available pathways forward , slow costly process . In light evolving GOC mining policy , shrinking “ facto ” routes formalization , intents purposes limited : ( ) subsistence miners able produce legally sell 420 grams gold year ( MME , 2017 ) ; ( ii ) miners reach civil legal agreements private titleholders legally titles , largely formalization subcontracts ; ( iii ) miners comply criteria apply Special Mining Reserve Area operate areas approval ANM . For ASGM operators , effective alternative apply develop open , untitled areas traditional mining title , moving exploration exploitation ultimately , closure . However , areas Antioquia , 95 percent department titled permissions titles “ place , ” probability finding untitled areas commercially viable low . Within context , demands compliance exacting GOC mining environmental legislation continue represent biggest challenge expansive ASGM mining formalization , truncated group pathways . Again , consensus industry players mining levels generates impacts planned adequately managed mitigated , focus costly complicated - mining plans environmental licenses effectively constitutes insurmountable barrier ASGM operators want formalized . By way example , Activity mandate support ASGM formalization , Oro Legal field team 17 technical specialists ( including biologists , water engineers , archeologists , ) comply demanding terms reference preparation EIAs regional environmental authorities cost roughly US$ 50,000 EIA developed . Further , EIAs years review , frequently generating hundreds technical observations , fully addressed approval granted . Unsurprisingly , given hurdles , perverse incentives quickly emerge institutional desire exhaustive environmental control ironically results environmental control . 5 . Obstacles formalization : stakeholder consultations In effort ASGM formalization agenda - new administration President Iván Duque , Oro Legal BGI ASM , support United States Swiss 10 governments , initiated process develop practical proposals National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 , preparation . This multi - stakeholder engagement process identify entry points existing legal institutional framework concrete improvements increase formalization ASGM operators . A series focus groups conducted April May 2018 , including 13 consultations small - scale gold miners sector stakeholders involved formalization process departments ( Antioquia , Chocó , Sur Bolivar , Santander , Cauca ) , representatives academia , non- governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , large private mining companies , government authorities linked sector . Interviews meetings conducted key informants MME ; MADS ; departmental governments , particularly Mining Secretariat Antioquia ; regional environmental authorities ; local governments , particularly municipalities Bajo Cauca , Antioquia shed light effect competing agendas perspectives mentioned , high staff turnover , varying institutional capacity , political constraints improving regulatory framework formalization ( JAA , 2018 ) . During consultation process , consensus emerged stakeholder groups number principal obstacles ASGM entry formalization processes , , taken , create immense disincentives operators investment . These key issues presented : Key Issue 1 . Disarticulation policies legal frameworks ASGM realities needs . National mining policies , laws , regulations , norms ministries , agencies , levels government create legal framework ill - adapted ASGM . Disarticulation particularly acute MME , ANM , MADS , , case Antioquia , departmental Mining Secretariat . For example , comprehensive requirements EIAs applied uniformly MPUs regardless scale , sophistication , equipment , processing technology , geographic location , ecological factors , potential environmental footprint . A plethora competing incompatible institutional interests mandates stymied collaborative processes miners rule - setting enforcement , consideration ASGM context actors supply chain , experience - sharing , awareness - raising . This situation exacerbated officials ’ limited knowledge - - ground realities scant field experience , leads distinct interpretations mining , environmental , labor , regulations extremely slow approval processes . For example , taken mines recently approved Special Concessions Contract Tarazá , Antioquia – recently entered BGI ASM program – 18 years work governmental approval maze formalized . There reluctance authorities recognize hard fact government manage control thousands ASGM operators . National regional mining environmental authorities largely absent mining areas , isolating decision - makers realities field leaving miners local mayors . This rigidity 11 lack field presence stifled alliance - building exploration co - management arrangements actors – large small MPUs , upstream downstream operators – approaches improve regulatory framework , aid GOC attain fuller compliance , foster higher performance sector . Key Issue 2 . Conditions favor informality . As countries , legality determined , formalization process Colombia wrought onerous , excessively costly requirements , lengthy review approval processes . As noted previously , environmental technical requirements operate legally undifferentiated type , size , location MPU . As ASGM participant , “ It mining Chocó La Guajira simple mini - dredge small pump operated people compared operations use heavy mechanized equipment . ” The main instruments formalization – PTOs EIAs – reach ASGM operators given limited organizational financial capacity contract pay highly specialized technical services prepare instruments subsequently comply approved mitigation , monitoring , operational measures . The cost preparing PTO EIA exceed US$ 50,000 , MPUs footprint 100 square meters . Except Special Reserve Areas , regulations prohibit grouping MPU PTO EIA . As participant lamented , “ It incomprehensible requirements apply vastly different operations . The obligations placed small miners scare . ” Further , rigid requirements “ - - ” approach approval PTOs EIAs runs counter intentions government 2013 National Formalization Policy recognized formalization process - regulatory compliance ( Echavarria , C. , 2014 ) . ASGM supply chains Colombia especially vulnerable capture criminal consortia . Remnant FARC elements ELN , lesser known revolutionary left - wing armed group , active remote mining areas like Chocó , extort informal / illegal ASGM finance operations ( DuPée . M. C. , 2018 ) . Barriers legitimate markets buyers criminal groups vested interests dominate commercial transactions . This compounded , comparison rural sectors , informal ASGM operators little legitimacy access legal financial services formalization invest improved practices . Traditions ASGM communities little valued government social historical roots traditional miners little accounted granting mining titles formalization processes , compared large companies individuals means . Key Issue 3 . Difficulty reconciling ASGM needs mining titleholder rights . Some larger private sector operators perception extremely difficult engage , negotiate , reach agreement ASGM operators title fully appreciate benefits making investment . This compounded companies perceive ASGM formalization priority government , judging lack engagement process . This changing 12 security concerns illicit economies tied illegal mining persist local ASGM operators increasingly organize express needs . Also , programs like Oro Legal BGI ASM helpful role honest brokers parties guide discussions legitimize agreements . Key Issue 4 . Limited development options subsistence miners . The GOC recognizes legitimacy subsistence mining , typically defined unmechanized mining brings individual gold panners rudimentary miners allowed produce legally sell 420 grams gold year . Leaving aside challenge illicit stakeholders co - opting miners launder illegal gold ( “ sting ” operations authorities unearthed hundreds taxi drivers , housewives , bakery workers , etc . , registered subsistence miners unscrupulous commercialization outfits , “ selling ” legally permitted limit 420 grams / year having knowledge sales taken place ) , broader development challenge miners . In areas Istmina Chocó , territory remains - limits larger - scale mining dynamic river systems isolated flood plains offer good conditions gold panning , challenge help geographically isolated poorly educated miners avoid exploitation plethora local intermediaries buy gold cash highly discounted prices . Against backdrop , BGI ASM recently launched innovative project gold panners Istmina , Chocó , brought 500 subsistence gold panners international supply chain . The linchpin initiative application internationally recognized diligence system implemented international gold trader based Colombia . This biometrics , documents , live video feeds monitor control commercial transaction pass formal banking channels allows segregation gold rest supply chain . The chain custody tightly controlled reducing level intermediation Colombia - based international gold trader exporting segregated gold directly Swiss refiner sells responsibly produced gold renowned Swiss jewelry brand member SBGA . The female subsistence “ barequeros ” benefit international supply chain capturing large percentage gold price additional SBGA - BGI premium payment . Additionally , project aims eradicate child labor Chocó region engagement local NGO . In areas , Bajo Cauca region Antioquia , extensive alluvial gold mining significantly reduced profitability gold panning , main livelihood large numbers single , female heads household . These “ barequeras ” report paltry returns panning accessible , productive areas usually mined successively illegal operators heavy machinery powerful washing plants . For subsistence miners , logical solution highly precarious rung ASGM value chain alternative economic activity offers decent wage . Oro Legal worked years group miners address challenges face support - nascent honey production Bajo Cauca 13 community owned managed apiaries . The installation 11,500 beehives 11 apiculture projects allowed 300 - mining families earn , average , 1.5 times Colombian minimum monthly wage ( approximately US$ 280 / month ) days work week . In second half 2019 , apiaries produced 90 tons honey , generating US$ 250,000 income families . This volume expected exceed 400 tons mid-2020 . While returns unlikely turn heads larger miners , thousands subsistence miners operate lower echelons ASGM “ value chain , ” alternative livelihoods offer stable , dignified , legal economic option subsistence gold mining . 6 . A proposal expand ASGM formalization : National Unified Formalization Plan ( NUFP ) The inputs conclusions stakeholder consultation process analyzed national international experts cooperation programs consensus emerged practical proposals reduce transaction costs formalization ( titling , PTOs , EIAs , monitoring , reporting ) accompany small - scale miners process . The recommendations presented Colombian government jointly United States Swiss Confederation respective embassies . The recommendations purposely modest scope focus practical steps implemented Colombian authorities entering wholesale policy reviews reforms promulgation new laws . The main recommendation creation National Unified Formalization Plan ( NUFP ) objective enable small - scale miners transition formality closely coordinating functions procedures main government actors involved . This approach consistent National Development Plan 2018 – 2022 lower regulatory requirements raise productivity private sector OECD , Colombia 37th member 2018 . The proposal NUFP built pillars : 1 . Differentiated approach . In recognition conditions , challenges , opportunities faced ASGM operators relationship large companies , separate categories defined ASGM concept “ traditional mining ” reassessed . This starting point distinguishing criminal mining operations miners want eligible enter formalization process differentiated regulatory instruments procedures tailored conditions small operators . This approach dual purpose allowing government transition greater number mines formal economy , better targeting law enforcement efforts mining operations wholly criminal . 2 . Simplification procedures processes . A single , - stop shop window formalization small - scale mining operators created based : ( ) aligning requirements review operational environmental instruments scale production - - ground footprint ; ( ii ) reasonable firm guidelines response times authorities review approve environmental operational instruments ; ( iii ) decentralization key 14 functions ANM department level ; ( iv ) issuance required Mineral Commercialization Permits according selected formalization pathway , designation mining areas specific recipients ( Special Mining Reserve Areas , new titles ) , application mining concession contract , operations contract ASGM located areas titled large companies . 3 . Effective articulation institutions national local levels . The NUFP define coordination strategy procedures MME , MADS , ANM , law enforcement agencies , Regional Autonomous Corporations ( departmental environmental authorities ) objective empowering local actors decentralizing regulatory authority , especially regions important ASGM sectors . More effective coordination contribute solidifying legitimacy State regions , located post - conflict areas . 4 . Accompaniment formalization process . As pillars 1 – 3 adopted , small - scale miners enter formalization process need support fronts . Technical assistance training required mitigate environmental impacts increase productivity serve incentive . This delivered network accredited technical advisors experience formalization processes creation “ ASGM service centers ” public - private partnerships . Access banking financial services needs opened small - scale miners point - - sale gold established offers transparent transactions based international prices internally accepted diligence processes alternative illegal markets buyers . Finally , financial incentives transition small - scale miners zero - mercury cleaner technologies provided current Mercury Law compliance Colombia obligations signatory Minamata Convention operational . 5 . Livelihood alternatives subsistence . Given artisanal small - scale gold miners struggle eke living subsistence level , frequently operating inhospitable precarious working conditions , NUFP act articulating mechanism relevant stakeholders ( e.g. , Ministry Agriculture , departmental governments , municipalities ) develop alternative livelihood options vulnerable miners looking exit ramp sector . Since options contribute reducing illegality negative externalities mining sector , logical justified allocate funding transfers centrally managed mining royalties directly engage private mining sector actors . It interesting Mineros SA , gold mining company operates municipality El Bagre , Antioquia , successful program produce honey natural latex rubber plantations formally mined land , serve model broader alternative livelihood initiative support mining companies . 6 . Permanent dialogue . Open , continuous dialogue critical success NUFP . The stakeholder dialogue spaces supported Oro Legal BGI ASM led proposal NUFP permanent expanded national level departments 15 ASGM prevalent . There precedent fora Mining Roundtable Chocó , principally government initiative . If meaningful alliance - building root create conditions favor formality overall performance change ASGM sector , concerned parties need equal voice . Such modality step co- management framework informal ASGM delinked criminality Colombian government count increasing number formalized ASGM allies strengthen governance compliance sector . Acknowledgments The authors wish recognize invaluable collaboration government Colombia counterparts ASGM , private sector , partners joint efforts improve performance ASGM Colombia contribution national development . To end , wealth knowledge experience progress achieved Oro Legal Activity Better Gold Initiative possible support United States Agency International Development Swiss State Secretariat Economic Affairs , respectively .

A single, one-stop shop or window for formalization of small-scale mining operators would be created based on: (i) aligning the requirements and review of mine operational and environmental instruments to the scale of production and on-the-ground footprint; (ii) reasonable and firm guidelines and response times for authorities to review and approve environmental and operational instruments; (iii) decentralization of several key 14 functions of the ANM to the department level; and (iv) issuance of required Mineral Commercialization Permits according to the selected formalization pathway, be it through designation of mining areas for specific recipients (Special Mining Reserve Areas, new titles), application for a mining concession contract, or under an operations contract for ASGM located in areas already titled to large companies.

       "'As the government of Colombia consolidates post-conflict conditions, the United States and Switzerland are providing assistance through the “Oro Legal” Activity of the United States Agency for International Development and “Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining,” a public-private partnership between the Swiss Better Gold Association and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. A consultative process with a broad array of stakeholder groups yielded consensus on the principal obstacles to ASGM formalization, which create serious disincentives to entry into this process. To enable ASGM operators to transition to formality, a recommendation emerged for a National Unified Formalization Plan, which rests on six proposals that largely align with current policy and legislation. Context and problem statement Recent administrations of Colombia have highlighted the importance of legality, pointing to the mining sector as a particular area of interest for national development. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important economic activity in many rural areas and has a long tradition in Colombian history and culture.'"
